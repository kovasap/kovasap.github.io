Moving your body is good for you, especially when regularly done. If you have to go to work every day, it makes sense to couple that mandatory travel with exercise to make the exercise \u0026ldquo;mandatory\u0026rdquo; itself! Inexpensive. Especially if you buy cheap bikes, bike commuting might be the least expensive way to travel around a city short of walking. On your own terms. For me, it\u0026rsquo;s important to be on my own schedule and not have to worry about public transportation schedules and parking time limits. Biking is not the only way to accomplish this, but it does a good job at it\u0026hellip;. # Done in Mid-August 2020.\nMatthew\u0026rsquo;s review and recap of the day: \u0026hellip;\n- Good examination of effective altruism: https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/ # \u0026hellip;\n- Map of what you can visually see from any given point on Earth: # https://www.heywhatsthat.com/\n3D map of all satellites: https://platform.leolabs.space/visualizations/leo \u0026hellip;\n- Mind Uploading: https://qntm.org/mmacevedo # Three Worlds Collide \u0026hellip;\n- Patch Notes: https://playthebazaar-cdn.azureedge.net/thebazaar/PatchNotes.html # https://bazaardb.gg/search?c=all\u0026by=BaseTier Mak Guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UqHwFWqz36OpHzGsJwV0rd5qnktSITkaewlAO_k0ge8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fp9dqu8veyen \u0026hellip;\n- Start with \u0026ldquo;what would convince you that you\u0026rsquo;re wrong?\u0026rdquo; # Talk about how specific possibilities make you feel, then try to pin down why.

One useful tool to avoid this is by constraining your problem space, sometimes dramatically. For instance, what if you could only fold the page and do nothing else? Suddenly, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier (for me at least) to start just doing something.

If systems independently let students test out of courses, or offered testing separately from training, this problem might be solved to some extent. Of course, in this case the testing would have to be very good, and some things are unfortunately hard to test for.

As I understood it he describes Marxism as not really an active proposal for how to structure society, but rather as just a critique of capitalism and a specific description of what about capitalism is wrong without any necessarily specific instructions about what to do instead. For instance he talks about how Marx almost never talked about government. It didn\u0026rsquo;t sound like he had many opinions about whether government should be big or small or whatever\u0026hellip;.\nMental # When feeling overwhelmed or incapable of doing something hard (or even understanding what to do!), try disconnecting from new (distracting) stimuli (phone, PC) and letting my mind wander.

This is a bad system because it\u0026rsquo;s easy for the player to forget to quick save or have saved a long time ago then, do something that leads them to failure and having to reload a long time ago in order to progress in the game. Also a lot of games have long loading times and quick saving/loading can lead to frustrating waiting. If you think you need quicksaving and quick loading in your game, I recommend looking into games like Iron Danger that have a time rewind mechanic which serves the same purpose but is a lot more ergonomic for the player to work with\u0026hellip;.\nRecommended Apps # I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on subscribing to any tracking app pro plans, so all these reviews are the free versions\u0026hellip;.\nReferences # https://tkainrad.dev/posts/managing-my-personal-knowledge-base/ https://vimways.org/2019/personal-notetaking-in-vim/\u0026hellip; Selling Stock # Selling stock at a gain is a taxable event.

Not only is it tiring, but I frequently fail at it; some of the tasks will just evaporate from my memory, only to be recalled a day later (or when there is a serious problem stemming from the task not being done). This isn\u0026rsquo;t helped by \u0026ldquo;trying harder\u0026rdquo;.

Specifically, these people cite the growing incidence of chronic disease - e.g. obesity - in our population, and criticize how the modern healthcare system is really a \u0026ldquo;sick-care\u0026rdquo; system that specializes in managing symptoms of chronic disease, as opposed to preventing that disease in the first place\u0026hellip;.\nWhat it it? # This talk is a really good overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop\u0026v=vK1DazRK_a0\u0026hellip;.\nWhat? # Accumulating enough assets such that the passive income generated from them exceeds your cost of living.

One cool way to make this work is to have a hidden dependency web (e.g. fire must be discovered before cooking), and then randomly select a tech to be discovered from the set of all techs that have had all their dependencies discovered. This would force the player to adapt to the consequences of what their people discover, and make the game more dynamic and replayable.\nInspired in part by \u0026ldquo;Why Greatness Cannot be Planned\u0026rdquo; by Kenneth O.

This is widely recommended, but also laborious and at times \u0026ldquo;flow-killing\u0026rdquo;.

He argues that our \u0026ldquo;higher minds\u0026rdquo; that are capable of considering many conflicting perspectives to seek truth should instead be driving the conversation. Specifically, Tim argues that all perspectives should be open to higher-minded discussion and shutting down discussion on certain topics is dangerously illiberal.\nTim admits that using our higher minds requires effort, and it is impractical to completely ignore the primitive mind. I strongly agree. In fact, I think that use of the higher mind to discover some truths is extremely labor intensive, and the resulting truths are hard won artifacts. To me this means that we should really do a better job of recording and cataloging these artifacts so that when discussion comes up about them, we can point directly to them as a way to end the conversation (as opposed to doing the higher minded dance all over again)\u0026hellip;.\n#I used to play Team Fortress 2 on a specific server (OSU) with a list of regular players.

If true, it’s kind of crazy to think that a large fraction of the financial inequality in at least the United States or wherever the study was done is due to financial literacy.\nThis got me thinking more generally about the price of freedom to make our own choices and to play the game of life. I feel like in a very individualistic society like the United States people have a lot of freedom with their choices and there\u0026rsquo;s relatively little guidance or forced defaulting that helps guide people to make the right decisions. For instance, I can do whatever I want with my own money: I can invest it in whatever I want, or just put it all in the bank without investing it anywhere. I can buy the most random stuff with it and there\u0026rsquo;s no real fall back if I make poor decisions - I just have to suffer the consequences. This is true with a lot of other things too like physical health, media consumption habits, mental health, etc. A lot of these areas are very unintuitive and difficult to perform well in so it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to “lose” the game of life in certain dimensions without the defaulting or other guardrails that are less \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; society would provide to its citizens. I think this freedom to make decisions and stuff has a lot of benefits but without any defaults I feel like you can lead a lot of people to make really poor decisions just because they don\u0026rsquo;t know any better and that can perpetuate a lot of problems like social inequality\u0026hellip;.\n#I wonder if a good way to improve posture would be to wear gradient shaded sunglasses that require you to look through the bottom of them to get a clear picture all the time?\nScapular squeezes are an easy exercise to do that might improve posture\u0026hellip;.\n#I wonder if code with lots of visual patterns would be judged as more readable than other code.

I tried three and definitely noticed the higher refresh rate even when moving the mouse on windows desktop. In games I noticed it as well.

Often I think the gameplay of an MMORPG - what you actually do most of the time - is one of its weaker points. For example quests like kill x monsters or collect x objects can be very tedious. Trading card games are generally pretty fun to play And real world trading card games already have an economy built in - trading the cards.

This is that, while these games usually have players control specific characters, in reality what happens is that the playgroup as a whole decides on the best move that everyone should take. Then everyone just makes the agreed upon move. This effectively turns a \u0026#34;multiplayer\u0026#34; game into a complex \u0026#34;single player\u0026#34; experience, where the single player is a group trying to come to consensus.

This is not in-itself a problem, but it does lead to some issues:... #In the US, a mostly agreed upon problem is that our legislative districts are drawn in a biased way which favors whichever party was in power when the lines were last drawn.

To be more precise, show the exact movement and actions of all enemy units that would take place if the player ended their turn right now. As the player plans out their moves, update the enemy moves that would happen if the player committed to their current plan. This should lead to a very tight feedback look as the player gets constant updates as the move their movement selection from tile to tile.

The road down to the Sunrise Mine trailhead was a bit rough in places, with at least a single large washout that I was impressed our large van could handle - the clearance was better that I thought! Our hike down the trailhead started around 8:30ish, after a quick banana/peanut butter breakfast.\nThe hike in was really pretty, with 3-4 stream/river crossings and some amazing mountain views as the trees thinned. Pardon the mediocre image quality : ).\nMatthew on the trail\nEventually the trail turned into a treeless alpine meadow\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and then into a talus field. The transition was marked by this cute campsite:\nKovas trying to find which switchback is the last one, so we could break off. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you still have a ways to go.\nA short ways up we saw this ice cave, reminiscent of the Big Four Ice caves we visited the previous day:\nOn the talus, the trail became hard to follow, and we lost it on our way up. We knew we had to leave the trail at some point, but were not sure which direction. On the Mountain Project guide there were directions to break off before the last set of switchbacks. But because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a map, we didn\u0026rsquo;t know when the last set were. Luckily we eventually found this trail marker, which marked our fork left, with the pass trail going right. This whole process led to a lot of confusion on the approach, and likely added 30 minutes to it.\nA view from much higher up that shows the switchback clearly.\nAfter finding our turn off, it still embarrassingly took us a bit to disambiguate which of the peaks we were actually planning to climb\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but we found it eventually!\nAs we closed in on the peak the Mountain Project description for how to approach got a lot clearer, as did the pass tail with its many switchbacks.\nThis reddish colored rock with a slight trickle of water marked the end of our hike and the start of our climb. We stopped here briefly for our last banana+bread wraps, left our bag on a ledge, and continued up! Our climb started at around noon; we lost some time on the approach pathfinding.\nThe climb up was very easy to track both by scanning for the bright, new bolts and referencing the Mountain Project description. The first pitch had a very obvious start, with three close bolts through a slightly overhanging juggy start. It was a bit intimidating as a first lead, but quickly confidence boosting as I realized the moves were actually quite natural.\nLooking down from the first belay.\nThe second pitch was more relaxed, and the third, long, pitch had a couple sections of hiking-with-a-rope. The views were beautiful the whole way.\nMatthew starting up pitch 4 or 5.\nKovas starting up pitch 4 or 5.\nThe summit!?\nLooking back at the switchbacked pass trail from a better vantage.\nWe reached the summit at around 4pm (behind schedule), but were treated with an amazing view anyway : ).\nLooking over into the next valley. The snow reminded me of the lava flows in the Lord of the Rings films. I wonder if they shot those scenes by just recoloring snow?\nOfficial! Funnily enough some of our friends from the UW IMA had just summited a week before.\nRappelling down was met with some trickiness at first; our first rope through went a bit off route and we needed to find our way back kinda awkwardly. The next couple rappels were very straightforward, until we got to pitch 3.\nFirstly, this pitch was very long to rappel. I remember having to daisy-chain some quickdraws together in order to keep a hold of both rope ends, but still couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it all the way to the anchors. Instead I had to stop at this tree with a sling around it (perhaps others had the same issue).\nOnce Matthew had also rappelled down, we decided to pull the rope through and belay each other off the tree as we walked down to the ~20ft away anchors. This is where we ran into another snag:\nSo far, I had been rappelling down the climb with this technique:\nImage source: https://ropeandsummit.wordpress.com/technique/belaying-rappeling/\nThis allowed me to use my GriGri for a more comfortable and safer rappel. Unfortunately, this method had the before unforseen drawback of making it much easier for the rope to get stuck in constrictions when pulling it through. This is exactly what happened when pulling our rope through on this pitch. Our knot got stuck about 5 feet from the upper anchor, and no amount of wiggling and pulling would set it free!\nVery very luckily, the other end of the rope was still in reach. I was able to grab it, pull it down, attach my GriGri, and then part climb/part jug up the whole climb back to the anchors. I noticed a clear spot where the knot had gotten stuck. I am extremely grateful that this spot was not further down the climb; had we not been able to use the other rope end to climb up we would have been very stuck. I then set up a more traditional rappel, rappelled down, and pulled the rope with no issues.\nThis extra \u0026ldquo;climb\u0026rdquo; burned even more time, and now we were very eager to make a hasty descent. We quickly finished the rest of our rappels and started scrambling back to the trail over the talus fields.\nBy the time we had reached the trail proper, the sun was already (beautifully) setting.\nWith the solid trail beneath our feet, we started moving faster, breaking almost into a jog as the trail got flatter. On the way down, we passed a very tired, but very chilled out family hiking up on a backpacking trip. Their calming influence was very welcome.\nOnce we had made it into the forest, we had to pull out our phone flashlights, as it was now completely dark. We managed to do this part of the trail in record time, only getting lost a bit on the largest river crossing. Luckily we were both able to quickly retrace our steps and re-locate the trail on the other side of the river without too much more time.\nWe got to the car around 9:30pm and drove as quickly as we could to get back to our campsite just after they closed at 10pm. The gatekeeper took pity on us and let us in without a fine or any other trouble. Our fellow campers were pretty worried about us though. Reflecting back on our botch rappel this trip made me realize that I really want to either have cell service or a satellite communication device the next time I go on a trip like this.\nBesides our rushed finish, this climb was truly spectacular. It was also a great sport -\u0026gt; alpine climbing introduction. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go so far as to call it \u0026ldquo;pleasure climbing\u0026rdquo; like a roped soloer we met two days before at Mt. Erie called it, but it was a really cool alpine climbing experience.

We mostly just explored the town on this day; my favorite part was the sauce shop that had probably 50 different sauces (mostly hot sauces) available to sample.\nDinner in Leavenworth\nAfter our dinner, it started to rain very heavily, and some members of our party were starting to reconsider our plans to camp nearby that night. Eventually we split up, with some staying in a hotel and some (my cheap self included) camping in the rain. Luckily, the rain petered out by bed time and our tent held out the moisture. We did at least have to endure a very wet, but surprisingly tolerable, campfire while we waited for bedtime.\nDay 1: Colchuck, Aasgard, and Finding Camp # We woke up early and headed to the trailhead to start our adventure.\nThe trail in was very well maintained and easy going, with us quickly making it to Colchuck Lake, our first destination. There were some bugs here which made me nervous for the rest of the trip, but luckily here was the worst they would be.\nOn the hike in I was pretty happy to have some old beat up ski poles that originally I had brought for someone else (who ended up refusing them). I had never backpacked with poles before, and was surprised at how much they helped me stay stable on the trail.\nThe imposing Dragontail Peak, towering over Colchuck Lake.\nMist was rolling over the mountains around the lake, making for a very dramatic view at times.\nAasgard Pass, our next obstacle, to the left of Dragontail.\nWe next made our way around the lake to the start of Aasgard Pass. The trail somewhat disappeared here into a boulder field, but all the landmarks nearby made it impossible to get lost.\nHeading up Aasgard!\nThe pass was very steep, but I was able to make it more fun for myself by going somewhat off trail and scrambling between the boulders. Frequently I would have to stop and think about the best way to navigate the rocks.\nDragontail Peak from Aasgard Pass.\nTowards the top of the pass I started running into more and more snow, under which I could hear the roar of water. Before the trip I had read a harrowing report of a hiker walking on this very snowfield. The hiker fell through the snow and was swept downhill by the water, only being saved by a lucky constriction in the underground river. Made me glad I was on the rocks.\nI noticed some climbers on a route to the left of me, on a beautiful very exposed spire. I also noticed a mountain goat and excitedly gestured towards it to some climbers at the base. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem very excited and later I felt a bit silly, as the goats were everywhere over the pass. In fact, for the next couple miles there would always be at least one in sight.\nMy first goat sighting! Later I would not need to zoom in so much to get a good shot.\nSee if you can spot the climbers towards the top of the spire!\nA more normal goat sighting, just a little while further up the trail.\nOnce we rounded the top of Aasgard, the valley below was like another world.\nWending our way through the snow.\nThe extremely cold lakes were a welcome way to fill up our water. One of my companions had a neat squeezable bottle with a built in filter, so we could easily drink directly from the snowmelt.\nThe next part of the hike was a bit of a slog, as we descended through lots of snow looking for a good campsite. I was pretty tired at this point, so constantly not running into a good spot as we passed lake after lake was a bit disappointing.\nWe did have one exciting moment where we needed to cross a pretty steep snowfield. I was first, and I tried to follow some goat tracks that made their way across. As I was crossing, I slipped into an uncontrolled slide down the hill! Luckily the bottom petered out safely, but this was my first firsthand experience with the dangers of steep snow travel, and why always being ready to self-arrest is so important.\nOthers tried to descend without sliding, but everyone slipped just like me so eventually we just started having fun with it.\nSliding Video\nTowards the end of our day, we finally found a good place to camp. There was only one more obstacle to overcome: a rushing river draining out of a nearby lake. Our best way across after much searching was one of the snowbridges crossing the water.\nSnowbridge Video\nNone of the snowbridges were particularly confidence inspiring\u0026hellip;\nFinally, we started setting up camp.\nYours truly setting up a tent in my climbing shoes while unsuccessfully attempting to dry my boots. Prusik Peak, our goal for tomorrow is in the background.\nThe ever present goats were with us even at camp. Once when taking a pee one came right up behind me and spooked me! They seem to be attracted to pee residue.\nGoats usually traveled in adorable families.\nDay 2: Prusik Peak # The next day, my climbing partner and I set out to climb Prusik Peak, whilst the others went off on other various adventures.\nFinding our way to the base of the climb was pretty fun; the wide open terrain made it easy to see where we were going, yet still was engaging to traverse.\nWalking on the gently sloping rock was pleasant and made the world feel wide open for exploration.\nFairly quickly, after needing to walk back on the trail from yesterday for a time, we found ourselves at the base of the climb.\nA useful map we used to try to navigate up the west ridge of Prusik. We still got somewhat lost at least once.\nAs you may see, the first \u0026ldquo;pitch\u0026rdquo; of the climb was really just a hike/scramble up what felt like a pile of boulders.\nLooking down the first pitch.\nThe views were, as expected, incredible.\nLooking back at our camp (located by the waterfall draining into the lake) from early on in the climb.\nDoing pitch 1 of climbing above \u0026ldquo;Balanced Rock\u0026rdquo;.\nThe climbing continued to be mostly an adventurous scramble more than a technical climb. I remember one moment distinctly where I was following my partner around a corner while on belay. As I rounded the corner, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but smile as I saw the rope just hanging in the wind with no protection between me and my partner fairly far away, and the rest of the pitch just consisting of a flat - yet quite exposed - ridge. Falling would have been bad, but really it was unprotectable.\nLooking up pitches 2 and 3, the crux slab pitch.\nA shot of us, as well as several parties ahead of us. Unfortunately, our route did not take us up the beautiful steep slabs to the right.\nThe route wound its way around large rock formations that made it hard to communicate and find the next belay. As an illustration, the trickiest part of the climb was not actually physically challenging, but a test of routefinding. Just after the crux slab (pitch 3), my partner, leading, had veered too far right and ran low on gear. We think he may have found a belay for one of the steeper routes heading up the south side of the peak. Eventually he was able to backtrack and get back on route, but there was a time I was just sitting there nervously waiting - walkie talkies would have been nice.\nThe best climbing in my opinion was at the very top (pitch 5), where we found some solid cracks to climb and even a chimney to squeeze through!\nA crack on pitch 5.\nAfter these pitches, we found ourselves at the summit. It was cool to see all the other, harder routes on the south side of the peak facing our camp site from above.\nA picture of (we think) us at the summit, taken from our campsite. Shows off some of the harder routes, one of them being currently climbed!\nFrom the summit we could see other sheer spires continuing down the ridge. This area really has so much high quality climbing to explore!\nSoon enough, we started descending, almost directly behind another party. All the rappel stations were rap rings through slings of a questionable age, but they all had 3-4 slings piled up redundantly so I felt pretty good about them.\nIt started getting a little gloomy as we descended, giving us some extra motivation to get down.\nOnce we got to the bottom, we found ourselves right in the middle of some steep snowfields. The party ahead of us had completely disappeared, without even leaving footsteps, so we were quite confused about where to go. We ended up having to do a lot of rough traversing of steep snow to get back to the start of the climb. We kicked our climbing shoes into the snow toe first up to our heels to stay secure and avoid slipping into a slide like yesterday on the trail - the runout here was much less friendly looking! I felt bad for my partner, who had tighter, less comfortable shoes than me.\nThe snowfields we had to traverse to get back to the start of the climb.\nSome fields were extremely steep and we spent a lot of time trying to find the safest way around them.\nThe start of our climb in sight: \u0026ldquo;Balanced Rock\u0026rdquo;!\nLuckily, we eventually made it back to the start of the climb without incident. The hike back to camp was just as enjoyable as the walk there - a relaxing adventure finding our own way over the fields of rock slab.\nDinner time!\nMy diet throughout the trip: I pretty much just ate raw rolled oats, peanut butter, and dried mango for every meal. Normally my digestion wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tolerate this very well (especially the peanut butter), but something about the constant exercise or environment made me feel great digestive speaking the whole time!\nThat night we played some cards and tried our best to ignore the incessant loud wind rushing through our campsite while sleeping.\nDay 3: The Long Walk Out # Our last day started with us packing up camp and chatting with other hikers making their way through the same trail.\nAs one of these groups passed by, one of their members tried to jump over the sketchy snowbridge we had crossed the day before and landed full force right in the middle of it. Of course, their heel broke through and I watched in horror as I expected them to be swept away by the river. Amazingly, the rest of the snow held, letting them get out of the way, but the bridge was destroyed.\nNote the footsteps leading up to the broken bridge.\nThis video shows the entire snowbridge area, post destruction. Note that the snow on the far side of the river was too steep to allow access to the bridge downstream to the right of the initial frame.\nAfter the breakage, the rest of the group opted to wade through the river upstream, which was treacherous in its own right (deep cold water with slippery stones below), but at least was a known quantity.\nOnce packed up, we started our hike out. At first we traversed through the fun rock slabs we had explored all of yesterday, but soon the trail became a much more standard walk in the woods.\nThe trail was very well maintained, with steel traction bars added to this particularly steep and wet section.\nThe transition from rocky alpine terrain to forest.\nA typical view on the way down.\nThe temperature got steadily more hot and humid as we descended and, thematically, the final area we walked through to get to the car was a hot, dry, dusty valley full of burned trees from a forest fire. By the end I was very thankful the hike was over!\nUs before and after the trip.\nLessons Learned For Future Trips # The squeezable water bottle with a built in filter I used a couple times was super handy - I should get one. Poles were particularly useful when backpacking. Wind at night can be very loud and annoying. It may be worth trying earplugs or something similar for future trips. Walkie talkies would have been very useful for communication on the climb, and possibly even on the hike depending on their range. Staying as high as possible on the rappel down from the climb may have given us some opportunities to avoid the steep snowfields. Someone in our group had a Garmin watch which showed our exact position on a map and our progress on an elevation gain chart. This was very nice to refer to every so often to satisfy curiosity. My boots got very wet after the first day of hiking, and I had trouble drying them for the rest of the trip. Next time I should bring a second pair of shoes besides climbing shoes, and do some research about the best way to dry boots overnight in the wilderness.

This book makes the strong point that human beings are not inherently perfectly disciplined, and will inevitably cut corners when doing a task many times. This is especially true when the corners that are cut are usually not important, even if sometimes they are crucially so.\nReading this made me think of the process of climbing, which has many such steps. So, in the interest of not skipping these steps myself, here is my attempt at a Manifesto style checklist. As in the book, I tried to make this checklist as useful and evidence driven as possible. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to make it short enough to be usable, yet not skipping any steps that commonly lead to injuries/death.\nBefore writing the checklist, I wanted to get an idea of what mistakes most commonly cause injuries when climbing. According to The epidemiology of mountaineering and rock climbing accidents, in Grand Teton National Park from 1981 to 1986 these were:\nBad fall, usually on lead (34 cases). Rock fall when climbing (11 cases). Getting lost off route (6 cases). Rappelling off the rope end (1 case). Rappelling with a bad anchor (2 cases). Not using proper protection (7 cases). Not using a rope (4 cases)! Not wearing a helmet (3 cases). Most of the injuries discussed in the paper happened on snow/ice, which I\u0026rsquo;m ignoring for the purposes of this checklist.\nInterestingly, most of these injuries occurred on the easiest routes (5.1-5.3!), which is in line with most of the anecdotes in The Checklist Manifesto.\nAnother study, \u0026ldquo;Rock climbing rescues in Boulder County, Colorado and Eldorado Canyon State Park\u0026rdquo;, has similar statistics. This study references a similar Australian study with more interesting results.\nCheck this cool data visualization using American Alpine Club data for another view into accident data. And this visualization by the same author.\nHere is the current checklist:\nBEFORE CLIMBING: - Ensure harnesses are on correctly. - Ensure belay device is locked and through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope is tied through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope has stopper knot at non-climber end. - Determine if any extended slings will be needed to avoid rope running over rock. - Discuss rock fall hazard and what to do if it happens. BEFORE RAPPELLING: - Ensure both ends of rope have stopper knots. - Weight rope while still using personal anchors.

Therefore, I generally keep my screen at a low brightness level.\nOn Linux # I use Redshift to keep my screen at a low temperature (low 3000Ks). Currently I use a constant temperature all the time, as opposed to making the color lower at night.\nOn Windows # I use f.lux with default settings (changing color over the day). I frequently mess with the color temperature slider based on what I am doing.\nSelective Window Brightness # On Linux # I prefer dark, lower contrast color schemes for coding or working on the command line. They feel easier on my eyes and allow for more variety of color for use in (for example) syntax highlighting. I find that colors blend into light backgrounds more, and are therefore less readable.\nHowever, most documents in the world are rendered with black text on a white background. I find this perfectly readable, but starkly different from my dark color schemes. This makes it quite jarring to switch between the two, which I often do when I\u0026rsquo;m writing or coding while looking at a reference document in my web browser.\nTo fix this issue, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a couple things:\nUsing a page dimmer in my web browser. This is generally a good solution, but (since these usually inject dimming javascript or css into the page that is being viewed) does not work when viewing web browser settings or reading pdfs or using any UI that is not strictly on the page. Boosting the brightness of my terminal and dimming everything globally. Works for all light colored programs! The best way I could find to do this was to take the colors in the terminal colorscheme (as hex strings) and increase their brightness value to make new hex string colors, which I used as my colorscheme. This definitly makes the terminal brighter but, as the brightness goes up, colors start maxing out util they all become white (#ffffff). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to boost brightness enough with this trick while keeping my colors distinct. The current solution I have is to selectively apply color filters to different programs using Compton. This is not a feature that Compton supports natively, so I had to apply a patch I found here. The patched code can be found here. To configure this method, you can add shaders (functions that change pixel colors) to the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in the root of that repository. I run it by adding this to my ~/.xinitrc:\n~/.xinitrc --- compton --glx-prog-win-rule ~/compton/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl:\u0026#39;class_g=\u0026#34;Google-chrome\u0026#34;\u0026#39; --backend glx -b Another idea I had to help fix my problem was to selectively dim brighter pixels, while keeping dimmer pixels unchanged. I read that using the HSV color encoding could provide a good way to define what \u0026ldquo;brighter\u0026rdquo; means and a way to change it. Luckily, Compton provided a easy way to mess with this! My fiddling can be found in the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in my fork of the Compton repository. One thing I tried here was to use a function like this to map the \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; (V in HSV) to a dimmer value (notice how higher V values are \u0026ldquo;dimmed\u0026rdquo; more than lower ones).\nOne fun tool for this experimentation was a color picker like this one. When changing the shader, the 2d color picker would have its colors changed, verifying the change made in the shader! For example, after setting the shader to map V values above 0.8 to 0.0, I could see the part of the color picker with those values turn black.\nIn the end, I may just stick with selectively dimming entire bright windows globally, as opposed to dimming certain colors. But it was fun to mess with and I may return to it in the future!\nAnother thing to try going forward would be other color representation models, such as CIELAB or YCbCr.\nUPDATE: One promising solution is https://github.com/yshui/picom/pull/247. This feature for picom (a fork of compton) gets an average brightness for a window by averaging the colors of all its pixels, then dims the window if that brightness is above a threshold. It didn\u0026rsquo;t work super well in my hands, but is in theory a better solution to this problem than dimming all windows of a certain app.\nOn Windows # Because I often game on windows, I prefer to have my secondary monitor be dimmer than the primary to not distract from the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing, but still be there to look stuff up. I use the exellent Pangolin Screen Brightness utility to do this.\nTODO # To link this documentation more with my actual config, one idea is to add something like this to all the settings I document in my rc files:\n## SETTING_NAME ## some code that applies a setting ## END ## Then, when I\u0026rsquo;m writing docs in this website I can simply reference the SETTING_NAME instead of inlining the code. To make this work I need to write code that parses all my rc files and constructs some kind of mapping from SETTING_NAMES to the code (and the language to get syntax highlighting right and the filename). Then, I need to replace the names I put in this documentation with the values from the mapping.

Idk\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes. I think an important piece to also consider tho is where the burden of effort lies, because rigor takes effort. Individual voters generally don\u0026rsquo;t/can\u0026rsquo;t put in a lot of effort testing ideas. Policy makers imo will put in the minimum effort required for each individual policy so that they can be productive. If there was someone more directly responsible for outcomes, that person would be directly incentivizes to put in the effort I think\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Idea spreaders right now are DEFINITELY not incentivizes to put in the effort, as you imply\u0026rdquo;\nLol inventivized\nIncentivized\n\u0026ldquo;Imo loosely regulated idea spreading is fine, as long as the people deciding what ideas are implemented actually test the stuff they implement and have responsibility for it going right\u0026rdquo;\nOf course if we can\u0026rsquo;t get the decision point right then we should probably regulate the idea spreading\nJust joining a work mtg fyi\n\u0026ldquo;I think the highest burden of rigor is only meant to be placed on experts researching some specific field, and there is a softer burden of critical thinking that should be placed on leaders. In a culture that values education, it would also be something valued/recognized a little more by everyone. The larger problem with leaders isn\u0026rsquo;t really effort imo, it\u0026rsquo;s integrity. Plenty of leaders are working very hard and putting in plenty of effort, just not towards the people\u0026rsquo;s interests, because there is some other incentive they care more about (?/influence/fame/power, idea spreaders want to get paid or be famous, politicians need favor with the right groups to be successful, etc.). On the systemic side, our systems need to incentivize integrity, because they don\u0026rsquo;t currently. On the people side, our culture could recognize and incentivize integrity more if the people recognize and value it more\n\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Many idea spreaders put in loads of effort, they are incredibly hard workers. But they\u0026rsquo;re not working to inform, they\u0026rsquo;re grifters\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how rigorous our experts are if culturally we don\u0026rsquo;t trust them and are more trusting of the grifters (and the grifted). Or if our leaders actively undermine them.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes true. I was assuming policy makers are not putting enough effort behind the task of rigorously deciding what \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; have rigorous evidence for their ideas, and that is why idea spreaders can work their ideas into implementation. Like you\u0026rsquo;re saying, policy makers also have their own biases that further disrupt their ability to pick the right idea. My thought is that if we can make it very clear/consequential when a wrong idea is implemented, maybe we can incentivize the selection of better ideas.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree that scientists/experts should be held to high standards of rigor, but policy makers should be able to do the job of reviewing scientific work and ensuring that is in fact well done before running with it\u0026rdquo;\nOr they could just trust it if there is a very clear widespread consensus among the scientists who actually know how to review that work\n\u0026ldquo;I think getting people to listen to the experts at all comes first. And doing something about corrupt actors and grifters. That problem is much more insidious than an ordinary bias or issue of rigor, it comes down to honesty/integrity\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah +1 to getting people to listen to experts comes first. My proposed mechanism for how to do that in this conversation is to give decision makers more ownership/accountability/responsibility over their decisions, so that there are actual repercussions to not listening to experts. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that if we can tie trusting grifters to clear failure we can help fix this problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For example, setting some kind of goal or metric for healthcare costs (Andrew yang proposed doing this kind of thing in his platform) , then setting a target gives a clear pass/fail signal. Then politicians would propose plans that they think will pass. Then they try them and the failures are rigorously scrutinized and punished with e.g. no reelection\u0026rdquo;\nDoing this kind of thing on small scales first would minimize risk\nCo2 concentration in atmosphere is another good metric\nOr something more real that co2 impacts\nI also agree that a more informed/critical thinking populace is very important\n\u0026ldquo;I worry it\u0026rsquo;s not enough tho, or maybe not tangible enough?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Even informed ppl can be fooled, especially if they spend less time critically examining ideas than those people who carefully crafted the ideas\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah I agree, I definitely think where we can we should quantify things and look for feedback where we can (definitely a mathy approach with the great intention of trying to be objective) but I also think that can be really tricky with a lot if things, especially if we try to attribute blame/credit to specific people/decisions. If we set up the metrics poorly and put too much trust in them we run the risk of creating new gameable systems for people to exploit. Decisions may also be good for the long term but have short term costs, and decisions can have far-reaching effects which impact the metrics/data of future decisions and leaders. This is the kind of approach most corporations try to take and a common issue is that it becomes too focused on the short term, potentially at the expense of the long term. Whatever metrics we use should be chosen carefully, and the metrics will likely need to be changed/improved over time. And there are lots of things that will still need to be examined qualitatively, without a clear metric\n\u0026quot;\nYeah this stuff is messy : /\n\u0026ldquo;I think some of the biggest things that need changing are in infrastructure. There aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of good direct metrics for that, it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing that\u0026rsquo;s really important to almost every area but in intangible/indirect ways. Still, there are clear problems with clear solutions there, a lot kf which relate to teasing out these bad incentives I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about and improving the strength and health of our democracy and checks and balances. Imo that is some of the most critical stuff that needs fixing, and it\u0026rsquo;s in the way of fixing so many other more direct/tangible things\u0026rdquo;\nYep. One thing I hope for in the future is that more people will be able to spend their time doing this stuff as our economy gets better at satisfying our basic needs.\n\u0026ldquo;I also agree that a more informed public has intangible impact and isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s another feature of the health/stability of our country. If we fixed all of our systems and made them much better but the public was still very uninformed, things could still devolve over time. I think structures (systems and policies) and culture (people, public opinion, values, opinions, education) are linked and it can be either a vicious spiral or a virtuous one\u0026rdquo;\nIt takes a lot of effort to find and champion the issues you\u0026rsquo;re talking about\nYep\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad we have this is text, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try to summarize this weekend and post as an essay/blog post\u0026rdquo;\nAt least for my own future reference\n\u0026ldquo;And the culture ones not tangible, it isn\u0026rsquo;t really even an issue we can fight for, it\u0026rsquo;s the rippling effect of all of our interactions and experiences\u0026rdquo;\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s ok with you\nYeah that lack of direct actionability bothers me : /\nYeah go for it\n\u0026ldquo;The thing you said about time is part of the argument tor things like UBI. The thing is, no matter how efficient our economy gets at producing, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily give the people time if there is artificial scarcity. As in, there is enough food/housing/whatever to go around but people don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it unless they work ridiculous hours (and maybe not even then). This is a really large topic, but it\u0026rsquo;s part of why people like to hate on capitalism recently. There are a lot of ways artificial scarcity is created for the sake of greed/profit, and if ? is what you care about, creating/maintaining artificial scarcity is actually what people with a lot of ? are incentivized to do in the current system\u0026rdquo;\n👍\n\u0026ldquo;If things \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;trickled down\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;, all the efficiency would benefit the people, but there is nothing in the system to make that so. It might sometimes in certain ways or might not. At the end of the day, the people with the money have the power for it to trickle or not and the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them\u0026rdquo;\nYeah we live in a very wierd society in that way. I guess at least it allows for interesting people like elon musk to exist\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m getting really tired of powerful people being so \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; haha\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey are you/Hari busy tomorrow? I was thinking it might be fun to come hang out at your place during the day, if nothing else just for a change of scenery )\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m free/down :)\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to find a break in the rain around midday if that\u0026rsquo;s cool\u0026rdquo;\nHari says he\u0026rsquo;s busy at 7\nOk np\nBut he\u0026rsquo;s free the rest of the day\n👍\nOn way\n👍\nBtw we birding up now\n\u0026ldquo;Another point about socialism: whenever a well-regarded historical figure supports socialism or other \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;radical\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; ideas (not actually radical but things we tend to strawman as radical), we tend to filter that out whenever we teach/celebrate that person\u0026rsquo;s achievements. E.g. MLK was a democratic socialist, so was bertrand russell. But also apparently there\u0026rsquo;s more technicalities to the definitions of different kinds of socialism which I don\u0026rsquo;t totally understand, like social democrat and democratic socialist are 2 different kinds of socialism that are both not the scary communism kind. There might be other kinds that have been tried before, idk\u0026rdquo;\nThat historical whitewashing doesn\u0026rsquo;t just apply to people but also historical examples of successful democratic socialist governments\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m reading the last book MLK wrote and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing so far. He touches on some of what we talked about wrt anger and emotion. He points out that rage can replace reason if we let it but also says people need to rise up with indignation to demand necessary reforms be instituted. So blind reasonless rage is bad, but properly directed, rational moral indignation is good. Not just good but necessary for the right change to occur. Sending snaps of the actual quotes\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;rocklike intransigence\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; (people become entrenched and won\u0026rsquo;t change their minds) and \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;sophisticated manipulation\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; (e.g. propaganda and maliciously strategic actions like voter suppression, gerrymandering, undermining or circumventing democracy) captures the major ways progress is difficult even when you have a good solution which could fix or vastly improve a problem if implemented. Maintaining a large complex system that works for the people is already difficult work (like it is in software engineering) but these other forces add a whole new level of difficulty, which comes from antagonistic humans abusing their power and platforms. That part of the struggle is not a systems design problem, it is more like a battle. These bad actors (think of them as black hat hackers) are very driven, and it will take a lot of collective drive from the public to get change through despite their efforts (preferably more from reasonable indignation than reasonless rage. But the less productive rage will always be there unless the problem improves)\n\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;There is a pattern throughout history where if a tension like this exists and worsens over time, the anger and frustration becomes more intense and widespread until it leads to revolution (a violent and chaotic one if rage wins out)\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can break down the \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;sophisticated manipulation\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; by manipulation of people and culture (propaganda) or systemic manipulation (the other \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;maliciously strategic\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; stuff I mentioned). A lot of propaganda serves to diffuse reasonable/justified indignation so change is less likely to occur (downplay the severity or validity of the problem), or redirect it to something else (twisting things away from the source of the problem to the wrong cause, or even another completely fake issue). But if problems persist, some kind of rage always remains, however it is processed/directed\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Problems in infrastructure are more abstract and less clearly/directly tied to the problems people get emotional about. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because of that lack of emotional drive that it\u0026rsquo;s especially hard to get changes through in those areas. This is also part of why I think the perspective of math is important, not just because it allows us to see things in a clear and objective way (as clear/objective as humanly possible), but it also gets us thinking about abstract ideas and structure. Better math education means the public is more comfortable doing that\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok I\u0026rsquo;m done spamming you with walls of text for now, sorry\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting! And yeah I think rage/passion is necessary sometimes to keep people behind a cause. Im maybe in denial about it\u0026rsquo;s usefulness\n\u0026ldquo;More generally, imo the harm of emotion comes down to \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reacting before thinking/reasoning\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;. But reacting AFTER thinking things through (and also being open to the idea that you might be wrong and being willing to rethink) is perfectly rational. Furthermore, sometimes strong emotions indicate a person is MORE aware of reality, not the other way around. If you notice your house is on fire and your emotional state is exactly the same as if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t on fire, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that makes you \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet come to terms with the fact that your house is on fire.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah I agree. I will say that from a completely naive observers perspective, the fact that someone is strongly emotional is not necessarily correlated to their viewpoint being accurate. And since emotions often demand strong reaction (e.g. support), a completely naive observer may be savvy to avoid the situation to avoid backing the wrong perspective (e.g. propaganda). Of course, this only applied for naive observers who haven\u0026rsquo;t seen all perspectives and don\u0026rsquo;t have enough info.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In any discussion, ideas exist separately from people and can be examined on their own merit, regardless of the perceived emotional state of the person presenting them or any other details not relevant to what is/isn\u0026rsquo;t true or valid. What this comes down to is rhetoric vs epistemology, \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;winning the debate\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; vs getting at the truth/validity of the ideas themselves. The former isn\u0026rsquo;t rational, it\u0026rsquo;s just what\u0026rsquo;s effective. The latter is how we can actually try to be rational, and we can try to take that approach as much as possible in a \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; way to learn as much as possible from any discussion, isolating/evaluating all points made by all sides independently.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rhetoric is still an important tool, and it can be used virtuously or viciously. Virtuous rhetoric might simplify things or illustrate things in imperfect ways but minimize the gap between that and reality (and often uses careful wording to draw attention to the oversimplification or caveats of a point), vicious rhetoric maximizes the gap ruthlessly to win the debate at all costs, only simulating virtuosity where necessary as a further rhetorical strategy\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really, savvy observers know the difference between rhetoric and valid logic/methodology and can see through vicious rhetoric. Education makes vicious rhetoric less effective and virtuous rhetoric more effective\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not just education, but also emotional intelligence and wisdom, to know your own biases and common poor shortcuts, and learn how to change or correct for them. Or even just knowing when they\u0026rsquo;re there in a big way, and having a healthy dose of doubt/skepticism as a result\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If your level of certainty is much higher than your level of knowledge/understanding of a particular area, it\u0026rsquo;s a sure sign of some bad shortcuts. It could be a wrong belief that\u0026rsquo;s held onto strongly and forced into any lens we look through, it could be we think of certain ideas as completely interchangeable when they\u0026rsquo;re not (but may still be related in a weaker way), it could be a type of confident and charismatic speaking really appeals to us, speech that is unemotional in tone, etc.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For me this is one of the most productive aspects of thinking about these things - you learn a lot about yourself and other people along the way, in ways that can\u0026rsquo;t be planned or forseen. If you decide to take some kind of action, you\u0026rsquo;ll do so in a less half-baked way. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t do anything with a direct outsized impact, this process of honest examination, careful thought and introspection can have rippling positive effects on the world and yourself\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was talking with Claire some more about this and it\u0026rsquo;s becoming more clear to me (partially based on her observations of me) that I am currently uncomfortable with ethos and pathos based arguments because I see them as shortcuts to an end goal that can hide problems. This feeling has persisted strongly in me probably because I haven\u0026rsquo;t faced challenges where those shortcuts are necessary to succeed. You are right that real rhetoric is necessary to accomplish societal goals; I think I personally just haven\u0026rsquo;t faced many/any of them so I don\u0026rsquo;t see it\u0026rsquo;s true value. As you can already maybe see from our conversations, I (currently) take a more passive approach to these issues in an attempt to understand them deeply (mistrusting shortcuts), maybe idealistically thinking that I even can do that. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this would win me much success in changing hearts/minds or even doing anything at all besides avoiding or running from the problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree that virtuous rhetoric is very useful, and distrusting ALL rhetoric makes learning anything really hard. I think some people selectively take the \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reject all rhetoric\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; stance to avoid inconvenient truths\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;(but they have to believe some rhetoric, like I do)\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I deeply distrust rhetoric and shortcuts and I think it\u0026rsquo;s healthy. I am not advocating for taking more shortcuts internally, but rather for awareness of the shortcuts that exist and a \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; to prune/refine them and not put certainty in them or hold onto them so tightly. This is why I also prefer cooperative discussion to competitive debate. In the former, rhetoric is not necessarily needed (or if it is needed it\u0026rsquo;s not relied on as heavily) and both parties benefit from understanding each other fully without appeals or posturing, and it can also be a more honest/open conversation, without fear of showing something which could be perceived as weakness (expressing emotion, admitting to not knowing certain things, admitting to mistakes in thinking, being wrong, etc.). Openness requires that all parties in the discussion can see past the rhetorical shortcuts and are invested in understanding the best version of what each person has to say (steel-manning), while allowing cooperative corrections/refinement of the ideas for everyone\u0026rsquo;s benefit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m also advocating for understanding rhetoric, how it fools other people and how we fool ourselves. We are not logical emotionless robots no matter how hard we try to be, and trying to view ourselves in that way tends to decrease our self awareness, hurting our ability to see our biases/shortcuts clearly. The shortcuts/biases are still there but we lose our greatest tool for finding them and push them further out of our conscious thoughts, making them more likely to deepen than to diminish. If we do this emotional suppression and also convince ourselves we\u0026rsquo;re being rational, we run the risk of becoming overly certain and confident in ourselves while being less aware of the weakness of our own thinking.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rhetoric becomes important when speaking to people who we aren\u0026rsquo;t sure we can have that kind of nice, healthy discussion I described with or when we speak with any kind of platform. I think the distrust of emotional people thing you were describing IS a rhetorical shortcut based on ethos. Full logos would take what is said and consider it for its own merit, based on logic and whatever other evidence/methodology is being used, treating things like emotional tone as just noise, not relevant to the ideas (this is how an emotionless robot would interpret what is said).\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you were to eliminate all shortcuts and maintain perfect awareness of your assumptions, you\u0026rsquo;d be doing math (or what math aspires to be, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee mathematicians don\u0026rsquo;t also make mistakes, but at least everything stated so clearly and unambiguously that the mistakes are not so hidden). Everything past that is progressively less solid and more uncertain, which is fine as long as you have some awareness and flexibility.\n\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;And yeah, people move the goalposts all the time for how rigorous/logical arguments need to be to be convincing and hold inconsistent standards for evaluating truth (as high as possible for opponents and as low as possible for themselves). People are suddenly very skeptical and great at finding flaws when looking at something they don\u0026rsquo;t want to believe.\u0026rdquo;\nSorry for writing another essay :p\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great, I\u0026rsquo;M sorry I haven\u0026rsquo;t been responding as elequently : P. Good point about the emotional -\u0026gt; less trust bridge being ethos based. That\u0026rsquo;s a good perspective; and it makes it easier for me to see that my correlation there is not necessarily \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reasonable\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\nIssues with Reasoning\nTo improve our condition in the world, one of the best tools we humans have is \u0026ldquo;distributed reasoning\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll define this as the ability of people to build useful models of the world in their heads based on models of the world communicated to them by other people. Through this process, new people, or people new to an area of knowledge can shortcut the learning process, enabling novel stuff to happen.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that the majority of communication that enabled distributed reasoning is rhetorical in nature; that is, it involves an asymmetric exchange between a teacher trying to persuade a student of something. I use the word \u0026ldquo;persuade\u0026rdquo; because it captures the changing of mind that is required when learning something new - or unlearning something.\nBecause our minds have limited memory, attention span, and processing power, teachers must provide incomplete arguments in their lessons. It is impossible in most cases to provide an airtight explanation for why what the teacher is saying is right. To keep arguments persuasive, teachers often fall back on assumptions, appeals to authority (e.g. \u0026ldquo;what this expert says is the gold truth\u0026rdquo;), appeals to common sense (e.g. \u0026ldquo;this is obvious\u0026rdquo;), or appeals to emotion (e.g. statistics presented in a scary way).\nAlthough this may seem problematic, it\u0026rsquo;s actually necessary to employ these techniques because, practically, people need to learn and have limited resources with which to do so. An alternative, pure epistemology is usually too slow in most contexts. For those who need to make real decisions now, going down epistemologic rabbit holes is a good recipe for failure.\nIn most cases, this system works extremely well. People learn skills quickly with it and, if the teacher\u0026rsquo;s lesson was misleading, they get fast feedback when what they are trying to do fails. This is very clear in trade-like contexts, like programming or building stuff. Hard science education also uses this system well. Most models of the world taught to students in science classes have serious problems with them, but are still useful stepping stones on the path to either further understanding or useful application.\nA bit of a breakdown occurs when the decisions people make based on rhetorical arguments have unclear or delayed consequences. Here is where being more epistemological becomes very useful. However, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes even unclear when decisions even have unclear results! For example, a clear cause-effect relationship with a subtle, hard-to-notice additional effect. These relationships are everywhere in complex systems like human societies.\nOver history our ability to execute rhetorical communication has only improved due to the written word and other media. In the last generation the ability of any person to participate both as a teacher and a student has been scaled up to a global level.\nThis intensification of our ability to distributed-ly reason, coupled with the unclear cause-effect relationships found in the complex systems we are reasoning about leads us to some unpleasant problems. Chief among these is the rampant application of very focused rhetorical arguments to societal problems. Anyone can throw down an argument with holes or that doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider the full picture and gain a following, since people are historically very used to absorbing such arguments. Since societal problems are so complex, thinking epistemological-ly more often than not leads to dead ends or unless findings, which further discourages eager activists from taking that route.\nSo, as a result, we find ourselves in a sticky situation. The complexity of our world has become daunting, but the average quality of our solutions to its problems are low. Therefore, the effort required to dig through and find a good solution is increasing.\nUnfortunately, the personal incentives/consequences for doing/not doing this work don\u0026rsquo;t always seem to be aligned with its importance. One great example is economic policy - punishment for failures is pretty low1. It is too easy for thought leaders to recommend arguments for implementation without consequences when those arguments lead to problems. This is especially problematic when those thought leaders have incentives other than those of the people they are serving.\nSee writings of Nicholas Taleb\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/docs/DRAFT-society-and-economics/","title":"Draft Society and Economics","section":"Docs","content":" Interesting Talks/Articles # Downsides of Meritocracy Excessive work justifying class is harmful for everyone, particularly the wealthy.

I\u0026rsquo;m writing them here so I don\u0026rsquo;t forget them, and so others might learn something - or point out flaws in my reasoning so I can get better!\nInformation, and Proactivity # Most FPS fights come down to proactively acting on information about where exactly your opponent is. If you know with precision where your opponent is, and they don\u0026rsquo;t know where you are, you can confidently peek at them and often even prefire (or shoot as you are peeking). Even if your aim is worse, you will most of the time win the fight because your opponent has to reactively (1) notice you, (2) readjust their aim (often \u0026gt;90 degrees of turning), and then (3) shoot - whereas you get to skip the first two steps.\nAdditionally, if you are peeking off of an information advantage, you also have the benefit of controlling the timing of the fight. Since you are peeking around cover, you can always easily reverse your peek and duck back behind cover if needed to reload or retreat. This gives yet another massive advantage to you.\nUsually, proactively peeking someone involves you moving, but it can sometimes involve you staying still in an unexpected place and using audio cues to anticipate an enemy coming into view. Here, even though you are not moving, you are still the proactive party - your opponent is reacting to you. Of course, for this to work, you must be sure your opponent doesn\u0026rsquo;t know where you are, otherwise they will peek you and almost certainly win since they control the timing of the fight.\nGetting and Keeping an Information Advantage # To win as many fights as possible, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to take those fights with an information advantage. But how do you get this advantage and keep it as much as possible?\nThe Cone of Danger # The most useful way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to do this is to always hold in your head a model of where your opponents might be. One way to think about this is a \u0026ldquo;cone of danger\u0026rdquo;. Imagine you can see through the walls of the map you are playing on. Then draw a cone from the leftmost enemy all the way to the rightmost enemy. This is the \u0026ldquo;cone of danger\u0026rdquo; you need to expect you opponents to be in. Practically, since you normally cannot see through walls, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to constantly estimate this, drawing the cone from corners enemies could peek out at you from.\nIdeally, you want to keep this code as small as possible:\nwhile making your opponent\u0026rsquo;s cone as large as possible:\nThe best way to do this is by making it possible for yourself to move around your opponent freely without them seeing you, while making it so any movement they make is detectable by you. This generally involves controlling (knowing for certain no enemies are in) most of the map.\nPractically, moving around a lot also helps mess with your opponents cone. Even if you have the ability to move around your opponent freely, your opponent will often make the assumption you stayed still - if they are right, then they have a very small cone when they go to peek you. A good practice is to always move after an enemy sees you if possible.\nDifferent games provide different tools to help determine where opponents are. Use these!\nStealth vs Spotted Mode # One helpful thought pattern is always knowing if you are operating in \u0026ldquo;stealth mode\u0026rdquo; or in \u0026ldquo;spotted mode\u0026rdquo;.\nIn \u0026ldquo;stealth mode\u0026rdquo;, your opponents don\u0026rsquo;t know where you are. When in stealth mode, the goal is to get into a position where you can get some free shots in on your opponents from an angle they aren\u0026rsquo;t looking at. Once you do get those shots in, or are otherwise spotted, you immediately transition to \u0026ldquo;spotted mode\u0026rdquo;.\nIn \u0026ldquo;spotted mode\u0026rdquo;, your opponents know your position and (you should assume) they are taking steps to peek you as unpredictably as they can. Here, the primary goal is to get back to either the safety of your teammates or a hidden location in which you can\u0026rsquo;t easily be trapped (e.g. a room with many exits as opposed to one or two).\nBecause the transition between stealth mode and spotted mode is so instant, it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to always keep in mind an escape route when you are in stealth mode, just in case you are spotted. This is for instance why a flank like this can be bad:\n\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; | \u0026lt;O\u0026gt; \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; | \u0026lt;O\u0026gt; | \u0026lt;You\u0026gt; \u0026lt;O\u0026gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; = Teammate \u0026lt;O\u0026gt; = Opponent \u0026lt;You\u0026gt; = You | or - = cover In this case, even if you get a free kill from surprise, your opponents could easily surround and 3v1 you once you are spotted.\nIt may be better to take an approach like this:\n\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; | \u0026lt;O\u0026gt; \u0026lt;T\u0026gt; | \u0026lt;O\u0026gt; \u0026lt;O\u0026gt; | ------- \u0026lt;You\u0026gt; Here at the very least once you are spotted you have a clear, safe path back to your teammates.\nOf course, doing a 180 degree flank may be totally fine if you have some other way to escape, either due to some map feature or character ability.\nPeeking Unknown Corners # If you are peeking around a corner into an unknown area with many potential enemy locations, it\u0026rsquo;s best to jiggle peak back and forth around the corner checking each individual location one-by-one. This will help make sure you are not fighting multiple enemies at once, and will give you control over fight timing. Be careful that this can be difficult when close to a corner, since every unit of movement you make will expose a lot more of you than if you were further from the corner.\nCover # In games like Apex Legends, it\u0026rsquo;s a good principle to keep part of your screen obscured by cover when fighting, to give your opponent a smaller area to hit. At the very least, make it so that when you are peeking out of cover you are also shooting - this way worst case you are trading damage one-to-one with your opponent.\nAngle Types # Whoever is closest to an angle has a disadvantage when fighting, as their body will be exposed before their opponent\u0026rsquo;s. Therefore, when holding an angle, it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to be as far away from the piece of cover you expect your opponent to peek out from. This also makes you a smaller target.\nIf you must hold close to an angle, you have to bank on your opponent not being thoughough and hide very passively, or be ready to aggresively peek with a close range weapon based on a sound cue.\nInfluences # Great break down by CoachNihil of kandyrew\u0026rsquo;s gameplay which helped inspire the \u0026ldquo;cone of danger\u0026rdquo; thinking.

This can be hard to implement in a game with lots of customization options (some builds might trivialize trials, and some may make them impossible). In this case what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen work the best is games that make trials on the harder side, but also provide intermediate content for players to do to e.g. level up their party. This way, players with builds that aren\u0026rsquo;t working as well can choose to just get stronger to the point where their build does work. And players with good builds are rewarded by making it through the discovery loop faster.\nGames that do this really well both with story and with character customization in my opinion include:\nFell Seal - Arbiter\u0026rsquo;s Mark XCOM 2 Urgency # Some sense that the player needs to do something to avoid loss is important to avoid players getting bored.

This is that, while these games usually have players control specific characters, in reality what happens is that the playgroup as a whole decides on the best move that everyone should take. Then everyone just makes the agreed upon move. This effectively turns a \u0026ldquo;multiplayer\u0026rdquo; game into a complex \u0026ldquo;single player\u0026rdquo; experience, where the single player is a group trying to come to consensus. Another way to say this is that the game starts getting \u0026ldquo;played by committee\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is not in-itself a problem, but it does lead to some issues:\nOften a few people end up leading the group, and effectively playing the game for everyone else. If leaders don\u0026rsquo;t emerge, it takes a lot of time to get everyone on the same page about a specific plan of action, which can make the game tedious. A Solution: Secret Objectives # Dead of Winter gets around this problem partially by giving players secret objectives that may be directly in conflict. This and some other mechanics make the game play more like a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; competitive game.\nA Solution: Communication Limiting # An elegant solution to the above problem (which I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried yet), is to put constraints on the communication that can be done between players during the game. Some ways of doing this include:\nOnly letting players controlling characters that are physically close together on the board to speak to each other. This is very easily done with chat apps (Discord, SMS, etc.). Putting a time limit (or character limit) on communication. If the limit is exceeded, then the players will lose turns - their characters were spending time talking instead of acting. These options are interesting because they produce a trade off - is it better for our actions to be more in sync, or should we just act with less synchronization?\nGame mechanics could also play into this communication limitation - for instance, characters that can communicate telepathically with others may be immune to any limits.\nComments from coworker to integrate # I guess you might break it up into a few more parts\nPermission (can I talk to this person at all) Duration (how much time can I communicate with this person) Dictionary-space (how much vocabulary do I have to communicate) Physical closeness \u0026lsquo;permission\u0026rsquo; and time-limit per-action/turn you cover, however there are two things I might add that limit effectiveness of communication:\nRole-playing Language limits With roleplaying, while it may be optimal to take a course of action, it may not be what the character would do (for example, against a demon and a lich it may be optimal to disrupt the lich\u0026rsquo;s spellcasting, but your character may have hatred of demons). This is most applicable in TTRPGs like D\u0026amp;D and Pathfinder and less applicable in Video Games or some Board Games. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t limit theoretical communication, but may limits it\u0026rsquo;s impact depending on your group.\nLanguage limits the dictionary of what can be said, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily limit how much can be said within that dictionary. For example, Gloomhaven before your two cards are selected limits communication to \u0026lsquo;relative\u0026rsquo; values (ex. I am going as fast as possible and will do an AoE) rather than absolutes (ex. I am moving with Mana Bolt at 07 initiative and will top with coldfire). This still lets people communicate freely, but can limit knowledge. This also encourages players building knowledge of each others abilities and what they do in combat, somewhat like a small group of mercenaries would.\nMechanic Ideas\n"},{"id":55,"href":"/docs/gaming/gamedev/mechanic-ideas/low-friction-turn-based-tactics/","title":"Low Friction Turn Based Tactics","section":"Docs","content":" Minimizing UI Friction in Turn Based Tactics Games # One-click actions # Games like XCOM, Fire Emblem, Warhammer 40k Mechanicus, Gloomhaven Digital etc. sometimes have a problem with requiring many clicks/actions from the player to execute actions. To minimize this, you could have the player\u0026rsquo;s options for what a character should do on a tile appear as a button on that tile. For multiple actions these buttons could be arranged in a grid.\nFor example, a character could move to an empty tile (just one option with one button). Or if they could cast an aoe ability on that tile then on hover that tile would have two buttons. Clicking one would automatically take that action.\nWhen hovering an enemy, buttons would appear for each type of attack the character could do. For out of range enemies, a shadow movement could appear when hovering to make the attack possible with just one click!\nShow Ability Effect On Hover # Another common annoyance I run into in turn based games is how many individual checks I sometimes have to do when making a decision for a character\u0026rsquo;s action. For instance, if I want to find out which enemy I want to attack, I usually need to go through each possible enemy in range, start the attack process, review the damage/probability/other effect preview window, then remember that information so that I can compare it to every other possible action I have. This is sometimes really trivial (when there is a single enemy, for instance), but sometimes really involved to the point where I need to start double checking the preview windows as I forget what they contained.\nOne way to solve this is to show a small pop-up preview window on top of every possible target when hovering over a skill/attack/spell. This mock-up shows a simple example of a healing spell with only the amount healed shown. In practice, you would also want to show probability to hit, any effects the spell applies (e.g. poison), etc.\nThis example is overly simple and doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully show the usefulness of this feature. In a real game, the diversity of outcomes would be much greater most of the time.\nEnemy abilities # One extension of this feature is to make it so that when hovering over an enemy the same pop-up preview window would appear on all the squares it can target (even with moving). The window would contain that enemy\u0026rsquo;s current intent given the state of the game, which would change as you moved your characters around. This would make it easier to see what enemies are capable of, and would make it less likely that the player would get blindsided by something they didn\u0026rsquo;t think was possible, which is a bad experience especially if it leads to the player reloading the encounter.\nAdmittedly, this might be pretty hard to implement completely depending on the game\u0026rsquo;s rules. Even if this isn\u0026rsquo;t implemented, games that are wholly lacking any way to see what enemies can do (what effects their attacks will have on your characters) besides doing all the math yourself I find very tedious (see the turn-based modes for Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity 2).\nMechanic Ideas\n"},{"id":56,"href":"/docs/gaming/gamedev/mechanic-ideas/positional-turn-based-combat/","title":"Positional Turn Based Combat","section":"Docs","content":" Positional Turn Based Combat # I\u0026rsquo;m a huge fan of the Darkest Dungeon combat system, where each team is arranged in a line.

Every movement made in this game produces audible sound, meaning that movement gives away your position and makes you vulnerable. However, like in most shooters,if you proactively move to shoot at a particular point, you will still have an advantage against someone reacting to your movement.\nThis leads to a dynamic where both you and your opponent are trying to determine the location of the other without giving away their own location - once one person knows withc ertainty they can simply move to attack and will have a strong advantage.This dynamic is framed by the asymmetric nature of all game modes, which have attacking and defending sides. Attackers must move to engage the defenders, meaning that they start out disadvantaged (they are moving and making noise while defenders are not). To counter this, attackers all have remote control drones that make noise when they move around. These are easily destroyed, but can be used to determine the locations of defenders, giving attackers advantage.\nTips # Angles to Hold # Long angles, longer the better Angles with wierd elevation Angles NOT to Hold # Short angles Instead, play next to the angle and peek when you hear movement on the other side.

Fighting in the center of the bowl is often very dangerous because you can be attacked from multiple directions at once. Because of this, it might be a good rule of thumb to fight on the edges of the bowl either against others on the edge or, ideally, against enemies in the center of the bowl. Likewise, it might be good to be aware of when you are in the bowl and make sure you can easily get out!\nScorpion Formation # The tank is the head, the DPS are the two pincers, and the supports are the body and tail.\nOne DPS is always on the left of the tank, one is always on the right This should help put maximum pressure on the enemy formation; it\u0026rsquo;s harder to defend against two directions of attack than one! One support focuses primarily on healing the tank at all times, the other flexes Communication # Led by a support, since they have the best view of the battle. The communication leader should call when the team is changing \u0026ldquo;states\u0026rdquo;:\nRegroup: Don\u0026rsquo;t fight the enemy, fall back (into spawn if necessary) and wait for teammates to respawn. This should happen when the team has a numbers disadvantage. Poke: Tentatively push up and try to get into power positions or the right formation. When this state is called, the leader should also say where the tank will go (\u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo;). Most maps have 2-4 choices for how to move out from spawn; use more precise descriptions if necessary. The team should then flow around the tank based on whatever formation is being used. Go HAM / Fire at Will: Just attack whoever is easiest to hit or you have the best advantage against. This should happen when the team has a numbers advantage. Ideally the team will respect the state that it is in and behave accordingly to avoid trickling.\nCoD: MW2 # This game was pretty mindless but at least it let me make a YouTube video with 160k views.\n"},{"id":69,"href":"/docs/gaming/games/competitive-turn-based/chess/","title":"Chess","section":"Docs","content":" Chess # I play my chess on lichess.org, which has a great UI and cool analysis features.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot from watching GothamChess on YouTube, especially his opening videos.\nI want to try out chessable at some point.\nhttps://www.alexcrompton.com/blog/time-thoughts-chess has good guidance for dealing with timed games.\nhttps://www.openingtree.com/ is a good analysis tool to identify weaknesses across all your games.\n"},{"id":70,"href":"/docs/gaming/games/competitive-turn-based/dune-imperium/","title":"Dune Imperium","section":"Docs","content":" Dune: Imperium # Agricola squashed into Dominion.\nVery fun and great theme.

For some reason the art style and especially animation really spoke to me, and I found the gameplay loop very compelling. Fair warning though that this game may be on this list mostly because of nostalgia. One aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the process of building your party over time and making sure you train the right characters. It\u0026rsquo;s very satisfying to help a weaker character finish enemies to get experience with the goal of making them a core part of your team composition later on. This is often fairly difficult - since the characters are weaker after all - which only adds to the satisfaction when you pull it off. Another cool mechanic in FE is building supports between characters. When two characters fight side by side they will over time build a relationship, which leads to little dialogue bites. It\u0026rsquo;s satisfying to discover these as you play through the game.Both training weaker units and building supports are examples of \u0026lsquo;meta-challenges\u0026rsquo; in FE; they aren\u0026rsquo;t required to finish the games, but give you self-directed and sometimes difficult optional objectives during the battles.Because these challenges are self directed they make me feel like I am expressing myself more as a player, which makes the game feel more interesting than if I was just solving the same battle puzzles as everyone else.\nFeelings:\n"},{"id":93,"href":"/docs/gaming/games/tactics-rpg/iron-danger/","title":"Iron Danger","section":"Docs","content":" Iron Danger # Really cool strategy game with a cool story.

This + the color difference was very noticible. Specifically it was ard to get the same level of sharpness as my other monitor for text. A 1440p 27\u0026quot; IPS 165Hz one This monitor was the best one I tried. But still the sharpness/colors were worse than my other monitor. In the end I decided to return everything.

It kills by slowly disabling the body and the mind over many years, leading to a massive amount of unnecessary physical and emotional suffering.\nPeople die with a lot of valuable experience/training/education. How would the world be different if people who fought in the civil war we\u0026rsquo;re still alive? Or people from the feudal age?\nDefeating Aging # The human body, like the global economy, is a complex system of many moving parts: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00252-6. Therefore, it reacts in unpredictable, non-linear ways when exposed to changes. This makes it resilient, but also counter-intuitive to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo;. As an example, ~90% of clinical drug trials fail, despite (presumably) all of them starting out with a good story for why they should succeed. This is important to keep in mind when considering ways to defeat aging - reasonable sounding theories will most likely be wrong and need to be tested before trusting them.\nSee Theories of Aging for some specific ideas for why aging might occur.\nLifestyle Optimization # Exercising, sleeping well, eating intentionally, reducing cronic stress, among other things all can delay the effects of aging. Regular exercise, for one, probably has the potential to add 1-7 years to your life.\nHowever, these kinds of optimizations have not been seen to dramatically extend lifespan beyond 80-90 years.\n\u0026ldquo;Unnatural\u0026rdquo; Interventions # "},{"id":106,"href":"/docs/health-and-longevity/alt-health/","title":"Alt Health","section":"Docs","content":" Alt-Health: A Critique # What is Alt-Health? # I\u0026rsquo;m defining \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo; as a general movement of people on the internet who feel that the modern healthcare system (\u0026ldquo;healthcare 2.0\u0026rdquo; in Peter Attia\u0026rsquo;s parlance) is \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; or not meeting the needs of society. Specifically, these people cite the growing incidence of chronic disease - e.g. obesity - in our population, and criticize how the modern healthcare system is really a \u0026ldquo;sick-care\u0026rdquo; system that specializes in managing symptoms of chronic disease, as opposed to preventing that disease in the first place.\nI generally agree with this overarching theme, and consider myself part of this movement to some extent. However, I have become worried by the lack of rigorous science (and thought) that goes into many \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo; positions. I want to explore this more in this post.\nInspiration and Backstory # I was inspired to write this when listening to https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/kaizen-asiedu; a \u0026ldquo;Nugget Climbing\u0026rdquo; podcast episode that talks a lot about the health in America. This episode specifically focused a lot on RFK, jr., a quintessential \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo;-er who has just come to some power in the Trump administration.\nIn the episode, the host tells a story about how he had psoriasis on the back of his head. He describes going to a doctor, being told the condition was untreatable, and being given a steroid to apply topically for the rest of his life to manage symptoms. Then, the host describes how he started reading more \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo; content and started experimenting with his diet. Miraculously, this experimentation led to a dramatic reduction in symptoms (much more than the steroid)! The host concludes his story by discussing how this experience made him feel a bit betrayed by the healthcare system, and much more interested in \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo; takes.\nFunnily enough, I have a story from my own life that almost perfectly parallels the host\u0026rsquo;s. In high school I played football and wore these tight padded undershorts 5+ days a week for practice and games. I think something about this triggered a bad eczema on my inner thighs that persisted for about a decade after I stopped playing football. Like the host, I went to a doctor and had the exact same experience: \u0026ldquo;your condition is incurable, here is a steroid\u0026rdquo;. Then, like the host, I started reading about and experimenting with diet, and also made my eczema completely go away. For me, it seemed like eliminating dairy from my diet was the main driver of my cure.\nI also felt a bit betrayed by the doctor - the word \u0026ldquo;incurable\u0026rdquo; so strongly echoed in my mind and made me feel terrible and defeatist about my condition. The fact that it was in fact curable despite what the doctor said was a relief, but also made me feel bad that I had to live with the defeatist attitude about an uncomfortable condition for so long.\nInterlude: Effect Size # Before going into different influences of health, I want to quickly describe what I find to be a useful way to rank these influences: comparing effect size.\nEffect size is simply the size of the effect you expect a health intervention to have. For instance, for me, eliminating dairy made my eczema go from 100% to 0%, a large effect. I have yet to notice any effect from Vitamin D supplements I\u0026rsquo;ve been recently taking, but soon I\u0026rsquo;ll have a blood test that will quantify how much my blood levels have changed (hopefully due to the supplement\u0026hellip;). This effect size hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to map to health outcomes I actually care about.\nResearchers use effect size to describe the efficacy of drugs or other interventions so that they can be approved (or banned) for general use by a body like the FDA.\nNote that it is quite common for there to be a reasonable explanation for why something should impact health (e.g. a molecular mechanism), but for the actual effect size to be zero or even negative. Many, many billions of dollars are continuously and painfully spent on drug trials that fail in probably the best illustration of this phenomenon.\nKeeping effect size in mind is a good way to consistency judge things that impact health, and helps prevent getting distracted by the reasonable explanations.\nSpecificity: An Alt-Health Tendency # As I have read books and articles about how to be healthier, emboldened by my eczema cure, I have noticed some worrying trends in the alt-health space. Specifically, it seems many alt-health-ers love to pick out very specific causes of health problems without evidence of a noticeable effect size in real people. These include:\nMSG and \u0026ldquo;excitotoxins\u0026rdquo; Glyphosate and other herbicides \u0026ldquo;GMO\u0026rdquo; foods Non-organic foods generally Seed oils Preservatives \u0026ldquo;Anti-nutrients\u0026rdquo; like oxalates and phytates Microplastics and teflon I see this happening for interventions that benefit health too:\nMost supplements (flagship example: resveratrol) Some specific diets that make sweeping generalizations, like the blood type diet It\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible that some of these things actually do have a measurable effect size that I haven\u0026rsquo;t found in the literature yet; if they do please let me know!\nI suspect people keep doing this for several reasons, depending on the cause/intervention:\nBecause it is neat and simple to say \u0026ldquo;if we only got rid of this, we would be so much healthier\u0026rdquo;. The reasonable explanations (not based on scientific data) are convincing. A low level disgust response. \u0026ldquo;Eating plastic\u0026rdquo; sounds bad to the primitive parts of our brain. Unspecific Cures # To be fair, many \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo;-ers (like me) are also big fans of less \u0026ldquo;specific\u0026rdquo; interventions that do have a well studied and measurable effect size. These include:\nDaily exercise, low and high intensity A sufficient amount of good quality sleep Consumption of whole foods like: Fruits Vegetables Whole grains Fish Meat (controversial), including stuff beyond muscle like organs Avoiding processed foods and hyper-palatable foods that make it easy to overeat. Note that these foods can be helpful if you require them to stay in energy balance, such as when being very physically active. Avoiding chronic stress, e.g. from a stressful job, social media, and/or their commute. Or at least being able to manage stress well. Avoiding chronic exposure to poor air quality, including smoking Avoiding excess alcohol consumption Avoiding chronic high blood pressure, e.g. from high salt/stress Avoiding heart disease risk markers, like high apoB, e.g. from diet Big Pharma and Doctors: Corrupted? # Many alt-health-ers have a strong distaste of the pharma industry, and use of drugs in general. In the most extreme case, their story is that pharma companies only care about profit, and would prefer to keep many people in a state of chronic disease managed by drugs to make the most money. Additionally, the story goes that doctors are complicit in this, and prescribe drugs to fix problems because they are also sucked in by the profit motive.\nI personally challenge this interpretation. One of the best alternative explanations I\u0026rsquo;ve heard from doctors is that they are as frustrated as anyone else, but are unable to effectively prescribe the \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;unspecific cures\u0026rdquo; listed above because:\nPatient compliance is low People don\u0026rsquo;t want to change their diet People don\u0026rsquo;t want to exercise People don\u0026rsquo;t want to - or can\u0026rsquo;t - quit their stressful job People like hyper-palatable food, alcohol, nicotine, etc. Some unspecific cures are hard to study, or the effect size varies dramatically patient to patient, leading to more time/energy required to effectively prescribe them (and doctors are overworked/don\u0026rsquo;t have this time) For instance, many people tolerate dairy quite well, but I do not. Most primary care providers do have have time to suss things like this out for every patient. Most \u0026ldquo;alt-health\u0026rdquo; specific cures have low or unknown effect sizes, so prescribing them is a gamble that will probably not pay off and may do harm.

Based on the information in the book, it seemed like fasting provided some easily attainable health benefits, if making it a habit wasn\u0026rsquo;t too disruptive to my life. In Longo\u0026rsquo;s own words, the diet is:\nDay 1\n1,100 calories\n500 calories from complex carbohydrates (vegetables such as broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, pumpkin, mushrooms, etc.) 500 calories from healthy fats (nuts, olive oil) 1 multivitamin and mineral supplement 1 omega-3/omega-6 supplement Sugarless tea (up to 3 to 4 cups per day) 25 grams of plant-based protein, mainly from nuts Unlimited water Days 2–5\n800 calories\n400 calories from complex carbohydrates (vegetables such as broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, pumpkin, mushrooms, etc.) 400 calories from healthy fats (nuts, olive oil) 1 multivitamin and mineral supplement 1 omega-3/omega-6 supplement Sugarless tea (up to 3 to 4 cups per day) Unlimited water The above components can be divided between breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or they can be taken as two meals and a snack.\nDay 6\nTransition diet\nFor 24 hours following the end of the five-day FMD, patients should follow a diet based on complex carbohydrates (vegetables, cereals, pasta, rice, bread, fruit, etc.), and minimize the consumption of fish, meat, saturated fats, pastries, cheeses, milk, etc.\nMy first FMD experiment happened shortly after reading the book. I attempted a 5 day DIY-Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) as described above.\nI used eatthismuch to pre-plan my meals for the FMD. I think it would have been much harder for me to adhere to the diet if I did not do this. Here is what I ate:\nIf my memory serves me well, I remember feeling quite good during my fast, which some minor headaches on day 2-3. I did this during my vacation from work, and I don\u0026rsquo;t remember working intensely on any particular project during this time, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t consider this a \u0026ldquo;stress test\u0026rdquo; of the diet.\nWater Only Fast - December 2020 # Further exposure to fasting proponents, especially Peter Attia (via e.g. his podcast with Eileen White, made me think about the simpler prospect of doing a water only fast. I finally attempted this during a work week in December 2020. My schedule looked like:\nTuesday: Large Spinach, Tomato, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Italian Seasoning Salad for lunch Some walnuts for dinner Wednesday: Only water Thursday: 4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate (in water) + steak seasoning Friday: 4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate + potassium containing spice mix Here are the stock ingredients I used:\nI felt surprisingly normal during my fast. Especially when exercising - I went on my normal ~3 mile run on Thursday with 25 * 2 sets of push ups and 10 * 3 sets of pull ups interspersed and felt actually better than I normally do. Perhaps this was because of the water/glycogen weight I lost at the start of the fast (~5 lbs, 190lbs -\u0026gt; 185lbs).\nThere were times when I felt a bit lightheaded also during the fast, but never too seriously. This may have been a bit psychological, since I knew I was fasting.\nOne thing I also noticed was it was even harder than normal for me to keep warm in my ~65F apartment, especially when sleeping. The Wed-Thurs night I did not sleep very well because of this. Any kind of draft under the blankets was very noticeable and interrupted my sleep. I wearing light sweatpants and a shirt the next night helped a lot (usually I sleep close to naked). On the whole, I would say my sleep was worse during the fast than normal.\nI did notice some tingling in my arms/legs, especially when putting a acute force on them. For instance, when doing push-ups, my hands would start tingling. And when putting my ankle on my knee when sitting, it would tingle strongly. Apparently, this is expected. This was reduced when I starting drinking broth.\nOne thing that I also definitely noticed during my fast was a shift in my brain activity. I felt much more \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; than usual - I had a consistant motivation to be busy in one way or another. However, I also felt a bit more impatient. If a task I was busy doing started to stall, I would eagerly try to shift to another task, or even multitask. This was good for getting lots done, but not as helpful for cracking a difficult problem (e.g. debugging a computer program) I could use this feature of fasting in the future if I need to be particularly productive in this way.\nWater Only Fast - June 2022 # I collected some data during this fast which can be seen at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gp4n59h3I0r1DnM8NQq4ISGtDY9ameoDuqInhsv2WYI/edit#gid=0.\n"},{"id":118,"href":"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/food/","title":"Food","section":"Docs","content":" Food # Goals # Delay chronic diseases as long as possible. Described well in this talk by Peter Attia. The big ones are: Cardiovascular disease. Cancer. Neurodegenerative disease. Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome. Maintain sustained energy levels as much as possible, avoiding: Periods of low motivation. \u0026ldquo;Food coma-ing\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Snack train-ing\u0026rdquo;, or continuous distraction by a desire to eat more. Current Eating Habits and Opinions (3/2022) # NOTE that these habits are obselete, up to date ones can be found here!\nFood Timing # I try to eat a breakfast after I wake up - around 9am, since I wake up around 8:30am. Then I tend not to eat lunch, and instead eat my second (and last) meal of the day at around 5 or 6pm.\nI converged on this strategy via the observation that eating food when I am not hungry (too quickly after my last meal) really kills my energy levels. With this strategy, I can eat two large meals and avoid this problem, maximizing the amount of time I can stay capable of doing whatever I want during the day.\nWith this strategy (and any food timing strategy IMO) it\u0026rsquo;s important for me to suppress suggestions from my mind to combat momentary ebbs in energy with a snack. This pretty much never works for me, always making me more tired then before I ate the snack. Green tea is a good placeholder to have instead. Or even better, an engaging activity that captures my attention.\nThis strategy also has the danger of going on a snack train when having my second meal. If I eat too much in the evening, it leads to much poorer sleep for me (possibly because the energy in the food is released as heat and excitement when I am sleeping). I don\u0026rsquo;t have a great consistent way to avoid this problem yet, besides my willpower (which is not consistent :/). Some tricks that kinda work are:\nLining up an engaging activity to do right after I eat, so I don\u0026rsquo;t just default to snacking more. Drinking tea or broth after eating as a replacement behavior. Fasting. # I haven\u0026rsquo;t done a long fast in a while, but am experimenting with fasting one day a week (Saturday) and still want to do a long fast 3x per year.\nDiet Composition # I\u0026rsquo;m playing with using this eatthismuch meal plan as a general description of what my food intake looks like. I should probably eat less fat to adhere to Valter Longo\u0026rsquo;s recommendations.\nConfidence Levels # Because it is hard (for me at least) to get good, immediate feedback from my body about which foods are the \u0026ldquo;healthiest\u0026rdquo; for me in the long term, I instead have to rely on information from other people to figure out what food I should eat. I\u0026rsquo;m working to combat this but realistically will need to continue to do this for a while. Unfortunately, there are many opinions out there about what food is healthy, and trusting one necessarily means discounting others, which might be right. Here I try to be honest with myself about where my personal opinions come from so that I can more effectively identify and correct them.\n📺 = I\u0026rsquo;ve been exposed to a lot of random media supporting this opinion, but don\u0026rsquo;t really understand the details. 📈 = This is an interesting statistical trend, but correlation != causation. 💡 = This is a plausible idea, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t found evidence that it has health effects in humans. In other words, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice conjecture, but requires more criticism. 📚 = This is the best explanation I know of, and has withstood a good amount of criticism, although of course it might still be wrong. 🧠 = This is a personal observation I\u0026rsquo;ve made about myself. TODO move these emojis to a more central location so I can use them in other writings.\nMeat (non-fish) # I try to avoid eating meat. There are a bunch of weak reasons for this:\nI perceive the supply chain that produces meat as being messy and suffering-causing 📺. Another way to phrase this is: I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would want to run my own personal meat-producing supply chain even if it was low-effort. Meat consumption using our current supply chain is energy/space/time inefficient compared to other food sources 📚. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a problem that we should rely on individual choices to solve (like other climate change related problems), so it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty weak reason for an individual to not eat meat IMO. Larger systemic changes like taxes on meat seem to me like the more effective way to take action on this information. Meat consumption seems be to weakly associated with cancer 📈 and other common causes of death. This may be because of the proteins in meat causing up-regulation of growth factors like IGF-1, which may accelerate aging 💡. The \u0026ldquo;blue zone\u0026rdquo; communities around the world with high health- and life-spans eat little meat 📈. Protein # It seems like low protein consumption (especially animal protein) might slow aging. See this comprehensive macronutrient mouse study. See also this review: The impact of dietary protein intake on longevity and metabolic health.\nNote that it seems like this is NOT true for people over the age of 65. At this point, loss of muscle becomes a dangerous problems (leading to falls, etc.), so the benefits of eating more protein to maintain muscle mass seem to outweigh the downsides.\nFish # I eat fish and other seafood, but rarely (I don\u0026rsquo;t cook it myself).\nEggs # I eat ~4 eggs a day ~4 times per week.\nDairy # I eat a small amount of yogurt and cheese. I try to avoid all other dairy products as best I can. My throat is irritated when I drink plain milk and excessive consumption of any dairy product upsets my digestion, so I think I am somewhat personally intolerant of at least dairy from cows 🧠.\nWhole Foods # This includes any food that has not had components stripped from it at a small scale. For instance, I would consider a berry a whole food even though it was separated from the plant at the macro scale. But jam would not be a whole food because it involves removing some fiber and other unknown stuff from the berry and adding parts of other plants (sugars) that were themselves removed from their whole plant part.\nI like the story I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about whole foods 📺. At the very least, it seems like we evolved to eat whole foods, so the floor for how bad they can be for us is fairly high and well known. Note that this theory does not say anything suggesting that whole food are the best diet, just that they aren\u0026rsquo;t that bad.\nIt also seems well supported and not controversial that eating whole foods helps delay the onset of the most common causes of death (cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease) 📚.\nOrganic? # I haven\u0026rsquo;t found strong evidence that organic food is healthier than non organic. But it could be that the right studies just haven\u0026rsquo;t been done yet or I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen them. Here is an interesting review:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658984/ I buy mostly non organic food because it is cheaper.\nWhat should I eat and when? (2021) # The most convincing diet structure I\u0026rsquo;ve found has been The Longevity Diet by Valter Longo. This diet is mostly vegan, with fish 2-3 times per week, keeping protein intake low. This podcast has a compelling dissent of Longo\u0026rsquo;s thoughts here; basically it states that Longo\u0026rsquo;s ideas makes sense, but so do many other ideas and we know now that insufficient protein can be unhealthy (I need to dig more into this) - the evidence to lower intake in spite of this is not strong enough yet. Note that personalizing protein intake levels while optimizing longevity seems to be possible by measuring Blood Urea Nitrogen levels as described by Michael Lustgarten.\nCool paper about food group epidemiology: https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/6/1462/4569801.\nThere are a couple of amendments I\u0026rsquo;ve made based on my personal experience (in service of goal 2 above). These include:\nNot eating breakfast. I find myself most productive in a fasted state (even a prolonged fast, and eating breakfast breaks be right out of this in what otherwise would be a very productive time. This is counter to Longo\u0026rsquo;s suggestions, some other research on circadian rhythms by Sachin Panda, and the American Heart Association. The arguments here often revolve around weight loss (which I don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with yet), and don\u0026rsquo;t seem too strong to me. This does help keep a shorter eating window on my day which is widely recommended: Sachin Panda Trying to eat grains and/or starchy foods later in the day. These foods uniquely mess with my energy levels. I\u0026rsquo;m eager to get some Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to see if I can quantitate this. Some interesting thoughts on meal timing for energy levels can be found at https://www.workingagainstgravity.com/guides/nutrition-guide/meal-timing.\nOther tenants I try to live by:\nEating whole foods as much as possible. My 2021 Food Strategy # Things I try to avoid # Dairy Meat Refined carbs (e.g. flour containing foods) Danger of Fast Carbs Sugars/Syrups In practice I may have small amounts (\u0026lt;1 \u0026ldquo;serving\u0026rdquo;) of these things about once a week.\nNote also that avoiding animals products is partially for health reasons (avoiding cancer primarily), but also partially because the animal food industry is not easy for me to support.\nThings I try to moderate # Eating more than 1/2 cup of (dry volume) beans or grains at once. A large amount of my calories come from these foods - I\u0026rsquo;ve just noticed that eating a lot in one sitting saps my energy, I assume because they take work to digest. One Meal A Day (OMAD) # I tried this for a while, and I found myself falling into the recurring pattern of overeating because \u0026ldquo;this is all the food I\u0026rsquo;ll eat today\u0026rdquo;. This is especially bad with lots of low-calorie-density, high-fiber foods (which I want to eat no matter what). The overeating would make me feel unfocused and uncomfortable for 4+ hours, which is not worth it for me.\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that a better thought pattern for me is to say \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll eat that later\u0026rdquo; when I get a craving for something right after a meal. This avoids a state of overeating, and I may later end up not craving that thing, which means I\u0026rsquo;ll eat less overall that day (which is generally good).\nHunger, and Physical States of Being # One thing I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed is that my body can be in different \u0026ldquo;states\u0026rdquo; that affect my hunger levels. Some examples:\nInduces Hunger:\nSitting around for a while (not moving). Being bored, or not knowing what to do with myself. Eating some food (e.g. a snack sized meal). The effect is more powerful when I eat something, then am presented with something of a different flavor profile. Overeating will sometimes make me hungry/snack-y for the rest of the day (or an extended period of time). I think this is partially because feeling overfull makes me less motivated to do stuff, and so I get bored. Working on something that isn\u0026rsquo;t going well. Generally stress. Food is a good procrastination tool. Suppresses Hunger:\nExercising Being busy Social interaction Taking a shower One theory I have is that my body gets hungry when it notices that (1) there is food around and (2) I have time/space to digest after I eat (I wont need to immediately do something that requires lots of energy).\nSome habits that take advantage of this concept include:\nDistracting myself with busywork when I feed hungry but don\u0026rsquo;t (consciously) want to eat. Eating one meal a day, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;snack-train\u0026rdquo; problem of having future meals induce hunger. \u0026ldquo;Snack Train\u0026rdquo;-ing # One pattern I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed in myself that eating food will put me in a lower-focus mood for 1-4 hours depending on how much and what I ate. If I try to do something that requires focus in this mood, my body will resist me and often want to eat more food instead as an alternative activity. Unfortunately, eating more food will just perpetuate the cycle; in fact it will become even harder to focus as more of my energy needs to go to digestion.\nThe key here is to break the cycle by somehow riding through the low energy mood without pushing myself so much that I want to eat. Sometimes this is really hard, because doing things that require focus is fulfilling :(.\nI\u0026rsquo;m basically just writing this as a reminder to myself to push through when I\u0026rsquo;m in this mood for the sake of my future self!\nMeasuring Personal Dietary Effects # Ideally, I would measure the effects of different foods on my personal health directly so that I know what works for me (as opposed to what should work generally). This takes work unfortunately. Here are some options that I should probably explore at some point:\nViome microbiome testing Regular blood testing w/Morgan Levine\u0026rsquo;s biological age calculation. See also Aging.ai. What fats to eat? # Probably mostly mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (not saturated fatty acids).\nhttps://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.040331 https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038908 Protein # Cool table of calories per gram of protein: https://www.healthyalyona.com/nutrition/plant-based-protein-lowest-calories/\nSpecific Food Notes # Sodium # Too much bad. See this Kevin Bass video for a review of studies that show it\u0026rsquo;s beneficial to use part potassium chloride in your salt source.\nProcessed Meat # Carcinogenic according to the WHO. They estimate that 34k cancer deaths worldwide can be attributed to processed meat, compared to 1mil to smoking, 600k to drinking alcohol, and 200k to air pollution.\nAdvanced Glycation End Products # Created by high heat cooking of especially protein-rich foods (e.g. meat/nuts). But all foods contain. Ideal to reduce the amount of this eaten.\nMichael Lustgarten evidence video Great overview/reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704564/ It would be cool to measure this in blood. Perhaps a1c inflammation test is a good proxy.\nThese are also formed endogenously when sugars react with proteins/fats (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product). This may be one of the reasons why sugar is bad for you.\nFlax Seeds # It seems like baking flax seeds will not degrade omega-3 content (biased source).\nNutritional Yeast # Contains MSG (probably not harmful) and uric acid (probably harmful in large quantity) (source). Also is a fairly processed food.\n"},{"id":119,"href":"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/personal-food-habits/","title":"Personal Food Habits","section":"Docs","content":" Personal Food Habits # Here I outline what eating habits work well/poorly for me personally.\nSee Personal Specific Food Notes for information about how specific foods affect me.\nCurrent Habits (8/2025) # Schedule # Breakfast: 9am. Mostly berries/fruit, with also a small amount of fatty yogurt, cream, coconut milk, or chia pudding. Avoid oats or any whole grains/beans. Avoid high protein or starch foods (eggs/potatoes). Some smoked salmon is OK. Don\u0026rsquo;t eat too much!! Overeating at breakfast is a good way to derail energy for the rest of the day. Lunch: 12pm. Salad with some chickpeas, fish. Also a good amount of bread. Avoid rice. Dinner: eat only if hungry OR if I worked out in the afternoon/evening. Focus on mainly whole grain carbs, some legumes, avoid too much protein and salt! This is to avoid disturbing sleep (I find whole grains make me sleepy, digesting protein/salt keeps me awake). E.g. Lots of raw tofu on bread made me sleep poorly Setting # I used to eat a lot of my meals while watching YouTube videos, browsing social media, or talking to other people I was sharing the meal with. I found that the extra stimulation/low grade stress from these activities often led me to lose track of my eating and/or overeat.\nRecently I\u0026rsquo;ve been experimenting with disconnecting entirely when eating and focusing only on the food. Usually this entails going outside and eating there. This has helped a lot to curb overeating, and gives me some time to consider what I have coming up in the day. I think I want to continue doing this as much as I can!\nPast Habits (6/2025) # Schedule # Breakfast: Avoid grains/beans. Eat a small amount of vegetables with oil. Eat eggs/fish. Don\u0026rsquo;t eat too much!! Overeating at breakfast is a good way to derail energy for the rest of the day. Lunch: eat one, but try to wait until hungry again from breakfast. This could be 5+ hours later. Eat a mixed variety, with more carbs than breakfast. Still avoid grains/beans if possible. Eating only fats/greens (like salad) can lead to low energy and continued hunger. Dinner: eat only if hungry OR if I worked out in the afternoon/evening. Focus on mainly whole grain carbs, fruit, some legumes, avoid too much protein and salt! This is to avoid disturbing sleep (I find whole grains make me sleepy, digesting protein/salt keeps me awake). Enforcement mechanism: I have a calendar event every day starting at 5:30 that reminds me of this item.

Not great to overeat on. I like to eat regularly for the omega-3s. I tolerate sardines and salmon better than tuna for some reason. Dairy: Makes me gassy and generally not feel great. This is most pronounced with milk and some cheese. Least pronounced with heavy cream. Eggs: No issues, although can take longer to digest than other foods; not great to eat them if my next meal will be soon. Legumes # Tofu: No issues digesting. Beans/Chickpeas/Lentils: When I eat these plain, I tend to stay hungry for a while and eat a lot of them. This invariably leads to me feeling very overfull and tired, as they are also hard for me to digest. Peanut Products: Good in small quantities, but very easy to overdo. Peanut Butter: Very easy for me to overeat and feel really bad for many hours afterward as I digest. Peanuts: Generally make me feel ok when I eat them. Peanut Protein Powder: I tolerate this really well even in higher quantities, making me think that the oil in peanuts is the main thing I react poorly too. Grains # Rolled Oats: I love oats and even eat them raw. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any issues eating/digesting them. Brown Rice: Good in small quantities, too much can make me feel bloated. White Rice: Similar to brown rice, and can make me feel tired when eating too much, which is easy to do. Fruits # Apples: No issues here! Bananas: For some reason, eating bananas alone can give me a short-lived headache and seems to mess with my energy. Vegetables # Pickled Onions: Upset my stomach except in very small quantities. I should avoid them generally. Onions: Eating more than a small onion will make me feel kinda bloated. Mild effect. Cabbage: I love cabbage, and it seems to be very easy for me to digest. Broccoli: Good in smaller quantities, too much can make me feel bloated. Roots # Potatoes: I tolerate these well! Nuts/Seeds # Nut Butters: Very easy for me to overeat and feel really bad for many hours afterward as I digest. Chia Seeds: I love chia seeds and have no issues eating them. Almonds: Good, just don\u0026rsquo;t eat too many. Walnuts: Good, just don\u0026rsquo;t eat too many.

The way it works is you take two foods that go well together (e.g. banana and peanut butter) and you add a third food that goes well with one of the foods but would be weird to combine with the other (e.g. spinach in this case). More often than not, the result is actually pretty good!\nBread Machine # Black Bean Bread # 1 cup water 3/4 cup beans black, , dry, cooked, drained 1 1/2 tablespoons applesauce 1 1/2 tablespoons honey ¾ teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour 1 1/2 cups bread flour 1 1/2 teaspoons yeast, active dry Use whole wheat cycle on 1.5 lb loaf.\nMicrowave Breads # Very flexible recipe, an example base:\nOne part unflavored pea protein powder One part rolled oats One part whole wheat flour Add enough water to make a runny dough. Microwave for ~10 minutes.\nThis recipe is pretty bland: I recommend adding more stuff for flavor, like:\nPoppy seeds Lemon Juice Banana Frozen Berries Cocoa powder Egg Microwave Steam Bowls # A really easy and convenient way to make some pretty tasty (and healthy!) food. The basic premise is that you add your vegetables with a splash of water to a bowl, cover it with a plate, and microwave for 5-8 minutes. Then you add extra flavors and enjoy! It\u0026rsquo;s easy to get creative with the cooking technique, but here are some examples:\nCarrots/Onions # Chop carrots and onions, add water and cook, finish with almond butter and salt. Add chia seeds optionally to soak up the water!\nThai Carrots/Onions # Same recipe as before, but instead of almond butter, use natural (e.g. Adams) peanut butter with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and optionally lime juice.\nHoney Walnut Shrimp Inspired # Chop cabbage, add water and cook with brown rice, finish with walnuts and mayonnaise.\nPotatoes # Poke some holes in them, and just throw them into the microwave whole for 5-8 minutes depending on size.\nOats # 1 cup rolled oats 2 cups water 1/4 tsp salt Microwave for 3 mins.\nTo make overnight oats, use the same ratios, but just leave the oats in the fridge overnight instead of cooking. I highly recommend addng chia seeds and/or coconut and/or some other kind of nut + some fruit when making overnight oats. Yogurt is also good.\nSome good toppings:\nCoffee (could even cook in coffee instead of water).

This is the most accurate method and also the easiest (IMO) when you\u0026rsquo;re cooking yourself because you can just put whatever cooking vessel you\u0026rsquo;re using down and put food into it incrementally and zero it out whenever you add a new item. There is very little thinking involved.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re eating food that somebody else prepared measuring things by volume is usually necessary, albeit trickier. One common approach is to use parts of your hand to measure, but different people\u0026rsquo;s hands are different sizes. I measured my hand size by dipping it in a blender full of water:\nWithout Fist With Fist For me this looks like a delta from ~630mL -\u0026gt; ~1100mL, or a total displacement of ~470mL, or ~2 cups!\nSome other estimates to use:\nA teaspoon is about the size of the tip of your finger A tablespoon is about the size of an ice cube 1/4 cup is about the size of a large egg 1/2 cup is about the size of a tennis ball A full cup is about the size of a baseball, an apple or a (normal sized) fist https://100-grams.blogspot.com/ gives a good view into what 100g of various foods looks like, which is useful for building intuition for non-scale-based tracking (e.g. Bitesnap).\n"},{"id":124,"href":"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/unhealthy-food/","title":"Unhealthy Food","section":"Docs","content":" Why Foods Are \u0026ldquo;Unhealthy\u0026rdquo; # They take up space # You eat them instead of other, healthier foods\nThey contain unhealthy compounds # Like trans fats\nThey are energy dense # It’s easy to eat many calories of the food.

For example:\nYou read that doing more Zone 2 cardio training than you are doing now would probably make you healthier. You have a mediocre blood glucose test and decide to eat more fiber. Decide (usually quickly) on a strategy to make said change. For example:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to go jogging every day for 30 minutes.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to eat a salad for breakfast every day.\u0026rdquo; Try to execute the strategy and fail. There are lots of general common reasons for failure:\nNo positive effects were noticed. The strategy was annoying or boring. The strategy was physically uncomfortable/painful. The strategy was time consuming. The strategy was too daunting to attempt. For example:\n\u0026ldquo;During and after my first 30 minute run my joints hurt a lot.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I felt super bloated and low energy after my 2nd day easing breakfast salads. And I hate their taste.\u0026rdquo; You incorrectly attribute your failure to a lack of willpower or an immutable character/identity flaw. For example:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not cut out for running. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the will to push through the pain.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t deal with the discomfort of the salads over my normal breakfast, which I\u0026rsquo;m now craving a lot.\u0026rdquo; You give up, and come away from the whole experience with a negative impression, thinking thoughts like:\n\u0026ldquo;Runners are crazy people who enjoy pain.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The salads made me feel worse, not better, and I can\u0026rsquo;t resist my prior cravings.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m ashamed I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control myself and stick to my new habits with willpower.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;This habit does not fit into my identity - I\u0026rsquo;m not the kind of person who can do it.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;These new habits wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have helped me much anyway.\u0026rdquo; You start preemptively ignoring/avoiding inspirations to do similar things in the future, because of the negative impression.\nThe core pitfall here is step (2) which then causes step (4). In my experience, failing in step (3) is almost always because I did a bad job in step (2) picking my strategy, not because a failure in my ability to execute.\nFor me at least, but I expect for everyone, different strategies work way better or worse than others depending on lots of factors, many impossible to fully understand. I wont try to enumerate them here, and knowing what they are isn\u0026rsquo;t even necessarily important to proceed.\nTherefore, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that if instead of reacting as in step (4), going back to step (2) right away - or spending more time at step (2) in the first place - would lead to a lower probability of failure in step (3).\nLuckily, there are usually many more strategies that it first appears to meet a health goal. This is great, because it means that failure with one strategy does not mean you are out of options - you can just try something else! Even better, this means you are free to go into step (3) with extremely low expectations, even expecting to fail, since failure is cheap.\nThe worst thing to do is become dead set on a single strategy you build up as the only solution in step (2), then try really really hard to make it work in step (3).

The biggest takeaway I got from it is that our tendency to break down foods and biology in general into atomic nutrients/aspects and pretend that is all they are (for easier study) leads often to bad models of reality. Biological systems are highly interwoven and the impact of stuff on them often depends on the greater context. For example, our body\u0026rsquo;s ability to absorb certain nutrients depends on what those nutrients are dissolved/complexed within.\nEnding Aging by Aubrey de Gray # See SENS.\nThe Drive Podcast by Peter Attia # Good podcast surveying many different longevity-related topics in a long form format.

One of the core thesis is that our western diet has a higher-than-historical ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, which causes problems. This is because the body can use these fats for the same purposes, but they have different performances for those purposes. For example, prostaglandins can be made with omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, but the omega-3 variants are less \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo; and may contribute less to heart disease.\nDoes a really excellent job of telling the story of the scientists who study/studied these fats, instead of just passing down diet rules without context.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_ratio_in_food has some data about omega-3/omega-6 ratios.\nHow Not to Die by Michael Gregor # This book is a good survey of diet from the \u0026ldquo;Whole Food Plant Based\u0026rdquo; perspective. Sometimes I think the author gets a bit over-zealous about how his philosophy is the best and makes lazy, broad, strong statements that are not adequately supported. For instance, dismissing certain foods (like meat) as obviously unhealthy without examining the counterpoints.\nThe author\u0026rsquo;s web site nutritionfacts.org is a decent source of information, though it suffers from the same problems as the book.\nGenius Foods by Max Lugavere # This book takes a more brain focused approach to diet, which pushes it more into the keto- space. AFAIK, ketogenic diets are more linked to brain health than other diets. I think it falls into the same trap as Michael Gregor, but not quite as badly. It\u0026rsquo;s a good intro to lots of cool food/health topics to explore more independently.\nWhy We Sleep by Matthew Walker # This book provides some insight into the mechanisms of sleep, and advocates that people should generally spend more time sleeping (or give sleep more value that they currently do).

Then the app uses your movements to wake you up during a lighter sleep phase. I\u0026rsquo;ve found this to be way more pleasant than waking up at a fixed time. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that I more naturally wake up by myself in the morning right before the alarm goes off, as if my body associates it with lighter sleep.\nThis app also tracks my sleep, which is kinda useful sometimes.\nCauses of Bad Sleep # Racing Mind # Anything that causes me to be constantly thinking about something will usually interrupt my sleep. This includes:\nTrying to make sure I remember something that I need to do tomorrow. See Task Tracking for an excellent solution to this problem. Worrying about an event or something that I need to wake up for (like a flight). Worrying about a personal conflict or argument, or any kind of unresolved tension between me and someone else. Trying to sleep right after doing an activity I was really engaged in, like playing a game. This will happen if my mind is continuing to ponder the decisions I was making in the activity, or if it\u0026rsquo;s re-remembering parts of the activity (and e.g. how I could have done them better). Writing the thing I am worrying down can help a lot to alleviate this issue. This makes me feel like I don\u0026rsquo;t need to keep the thoughts in my mind to remember them.\nFood # Eating more that ~1/3 of my daily calories, especially from high protein foods like nuts/nut butters, in the 5-6 hours before sleeping will often lead to me getting overheated and sweaty after being asleep for a couple hours. This is especially true if it\u0026rsquo;s otherwise cold in the room where I\u0026rsquo;m sleeping and I need to tuck myself in more tightly to my blankets. Eating protein at other parts of the day helps with this.\nEating bread or grains generally 2-3 hours before bed seems to help me sleep better.\nCaffeine definitely does not help me sleep :).\nDirty Sheets # Clean sheets, or specifically sheets that I haven\u0026rsquo;t sweated in before make it much less likely that I will sweat when sleeping (all else being equal), which in turn will make me sleep better.\nTemperature and Airflow # Skin Stimulation # For me I find that keeping my skin calm makes a big difference to my sleep quality. For me, this means keeping myself a proper temperature and keeping myself protected from breezes and other forces that can tickle or otherwise stimulate my skin.\nIn practice, I best accomplish this by:\nWearing socks or lower-leg warmers to sleep so that my feet don\u0026rsquo;t get uncomfortably cold. See this cool paper about hands/feet and temperature regulation. Wearing boxers. Wrapping myself with flannel or otherwise \u0026ldquo;warm-feeling\u0026rdquo; sheets to that my skin is constantly in contact with something constant and not exposed to fluctuations in air temperature or movement. Cold # One common pattern I fall into that leads to poor sleep is being too cold when going to sleep. This leads me to tightly hug my arms close to my self and tuck my sheets up to my neck (holding onto them with my hands). While this is comfortable when going to sleep, I find that it leads me to overheat once I actually do fall asleep. This leads to me getting sweaty, and then cold and uncomfortable. I feel a similar effect when using sleeping bags or wearing a shirt when going to bed.\nI think the best way to manage this problem is actually to warm myself up before getting into bed. When I don\u0026rsquo;t do this I find getting warm while in bed (even with a heated mattress) takes a long time and may not fully happen before I fall asleep, leading to the bundling problem.\nDue to this pattern, I find that it\u0026rsquo;s paradoxically better for me to use more blankets and/or a heated mattress pad and fall asleep in a more relaxed posture with looser sheets/more airflow. This is less likely to cause the overheating -\u0026gt; sweaty -\u0026gt; cold/uncomfortable issue.\nIn addition to making me bundle myself too tightly when going to sleep, being cold also just generally stimulates my mind/body, which hinders my ability to fall asleep.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found a good way to manage cold is to use a heated mattress pad or heated blanket to pre-warm my bed, which helps me feel relaxed and warm as I get into bed. Then, right before going to sleep, I turn off the heat and make sure I have enough warm blankets around in case I do end up cooling down. This is less effective than just getting warm before going to bed though.\nShowering # Taking a shower generally gives me temperature sensitive skin that makes it hard to find a good equilibrium when falling asleep, making it more likely that I\u0026rsquo;ll get too cold or overheat later in the night.\nGoing to sleep with wet hair from a shower also can exacerbate temperature issues. At the very least it make my pillow wet, which is annoying.\nI find that showering ~2 hours before sleeping makes these non-issues.\nSnoring # Not I problem I currently have, luckily.\nSeems to correlate with increased adiposity.\nInteresting Trends # Several behaviors seem to correlate with dream presence and intensity for me in a dose-dependent way:\nPlaying video games in the evening, especially role-playing type games.

Unfortunately, there is a great deal of variation between different people in what is physically healthy for them, and both studies and anecdotes can be systematically flawed.\nProbably the most reliable way to stay vigorous and healthy for the longest possible time is by self-experimenting to see what behaviors work best for you.

Property Land Value: The value of the land the property sits on. This is used to calculate depreciation (since land doesn\u0026rsquo;t depreciate, only man made structures do). In you live in the Seattle area, you can find this information by searching for the property on https://gismaps.kingcounty.gov/parcelviewer2/. Property Tax Rate: Can also be found on a local parcel viewer resource, or even on listings. Taxes collected on properties are public record in the US. Using prior year taxes is usually a good way to estimate this; I found that the tax appraisals for properties can value them very differently than the market does, so multiplying the list price by the tax rate to calculate this is not recommended. Depreciation Period: The time after which you can assume (for tax purposes) that your property will completely turn to worthless dust. This only applies if you are using part of your property for business purposes (renting it). Income Tax Rate: The rate at which any rental income will be taxed. Note that I am assuming your income tax rate doesn\u0026rsquo;t change over the course of owning the property. Since income taxes on rent are essentially deferred due to depreciation and then depreciation recapture on sale, your return will be better if your income tax rate is lower when you sell the property. Depreciation Recapture Tax Rate: The rate at which depreciation recapture income will be taxed. This is your ordinary income tax rate when you sell the property OR 25%, whichever is larger. Debt # Down Payment: How much upfront you will be paying for the house (in your own cash). Years: The time after which your mortgage will be fully paid. Interest Rate: Multiplying this percent by the remaining loan balance after a given year tells you how much you have to pay your lender for the privilege of using their money. Goals # Investment Growth Rate: How much you expect your other investments to grow by yearly on average. This just color-codes the results (green is better than your other investments, red is worse). Investment Tolerance: Results minus this amount from your investment growth rate will be colored yellow. Personal monthly \u0026ldquo;rent\u0026rdquo;: This quantifies the amount of value you personally extract from the home by living in it. This makes comparisons between investments more fair, because you can\u0026rsquo;t live in a stock! A good ballpark for this number is your current rent, or a rent that you would be comfortable paying. Max Upfront Costs: The total maximum amount of money upfront you can spend on the house. Used for color coding. Max Monthly Costs: The maximum amount of money you can spend on the house per month on average. You should always have some buffer, since many housing expenses come in large lump payments. Used for color coding. Portfolio Start Size: The amount of money you have in your investment portfolio when you buy the home. Used to calculate how much of your investment portfolio is made up of by the house Yearly Investment: The amount of money you are investing per year into your portfolio. Used to calculate how much of your investment portfolio is made up of by the house Income # Rent: The amount of rent you expect to earn from tenants living on your property. Percentage Rented: The percentage of your house that is considered rented. I think you can calculate this using square footage. This determines how much of all your expenses you can use to cancel out income taxes as a business expense. Occupancy Rate: What percent of the time you expect to have rent flowing in. Rental Growth Rate: How much you expect rents to increase by in a year. Monthly Expenses # Various expenses that need to be paid every month by you on behalf of the whole house. Notice the tax deduction rate assumes that these services will be used evenly by you and your tenants.\nSelling Costs # Capital Gains Rate: The percentage of {the price you are selling the property at minus the amount you bought it for} that you must pay as tax. Up to 250k for single owner or 500k for a joint ownership of capital gains can be ignored for a single family home. In a duplex, this can be applied to % of the property, the rest is subject to tax (unless you do a 1031 exchange). See https://finance.zacks.com/rental-income-taxed-duplex-7533.html. Note also that if you are using depreciation to offset your income tax while you own the property, this lowers your cost basis in the house, which increases your capital gains tax. Additionally, this \u0026ldquo;depreciation recapture\u0026rdquo; tax is taxed at normal income tax rate, since that is what it offset earlier. Closing Costs: The percentage of the selling price you have to pay to agents that help you sell the house. You can reduce this greatly by selling by owner, but then you might not get the best buyer. Upfront Buying Costs # Various expenses and fees that you must pay when you are buying the home up front.\nResults # Time: Year after purchase that you would be selling the house (assuming \u0026ldquo;Months Per Row\u0026rdquo; is set to 12, the default). Rental Revenue: Total amount of money paid to you by renters in that year. Property Value: The amount of money you could sell the property for. Property Gain: Amount the property grew in value by in the last year. Net Gain: Amount of money you \u0026ldquo;made\u0026rdquo; this year via rent and property growth. Property Tax: \u0026ldquo;Rent\u0026rdquo; you must pay your city/government for owning your property. Mortgage Payment: The amount of money that you must pay your lender towards your loan. Interest Paid: The amount of money going to your lender that goes directly to them as a fee for you using their money. Principle Paid: The amount of money going to your lender that effectively purchases part of your property (equity) from them. Loan Amount Left: The amount of your loan left to pay off. Expenses: Total expenses paid from the \u0026ldquo;Monthly Expenses\u0026rdquo; input section. Unrecoverable Loss: The total amount of money that you spent this year that you will never see again :). Depreciation: How much of your property you lost as it crumbled to dust (as far as the IRS is concerned). Total Tax Deductions: The total expenses you can deduct as business expenses from your taxes. Taxable Income: The income from your property that is taxable as ordinary income. Income Tax Paid: The amount of income tax you actually need to pay this year because you own your property. Total Expense: The total amount you must pay this year to others. Cash Flow: The total amount paid to you by others minus the total amount you must pay to others. Monthly Cash Flow: The last column divided by \u0026ldquo;Months Per Row\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Rent\u0026rdquo;: The total amount of value you extract from living in the property (see \u0026ldquo;Goals\u0026rdquo; input section). \u0026ldquo;Rent\u0026rdquo; Cashflow: Cashflow considering the \u0026ldquo;rent\u0026rdquo; you are \u0026ldquo;paying\u0026rdquo;. Money Put In: The total amount of money you have spent on the property. Rest of Portfolio Value: The value of your investments, minus the house. Percent of Portfolio: The percentage of the portfolio that is made up of by the house. Money Put In w/\u0026ldquo;Rent\u0026rdquo;: The \u0026ldquo;Money Put In\u0026rdquo; column considering the \u0026ldquo;rent\u0026rdquo; you are \u0026ldquo;paying\u0026rdquo;. Cost to Sell: The amount of money you need to pay to others when selling the house. This includes paying off the mortgage, paying realtors, etc. Depreciation Recapture: The amount of money you have written off your taxes so far due to property depreciation - if the property value has increased despite this depreciation, you need to pay it back. Cost Basis: The amount you bought the house for plus any improvements, adjusted by how much of it you own this year. Capital Gains: How much your property has appreciated since you bought it, adjusted for how much of it you own this year. Total Sale Tax: How much in tax you would have to pay if you sold the property this year, including capital gains tax and depreciation recapture income tax. Sale Proceeds: The amount of money you would end up with in cash after the sale of the property this year. IRR: The time-adjusted rate of return you have made on all the money you put into the property. IRR w/\u0026ldquo;Rent\u0026rdquo;: The time-adjusted rate of return you have made on all the money you put into the property, considering also the value you got out of it by living in it. If this value is less than your expected investment growth rate, financially you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t buy the house. Portfolio Return w/\u0026ldquo;Rent\u0026rdquo;: The return of your entire portfolio including the house, given that you sell the house this year. Rental Delta: To translate the rate of return to a \u0026ldquo;dollars per month\u0026rdquo; figure, fill in the top cell of this column until the IRR w/Rent Delta column matches your expected Investment Growth Rate for the year you are planning to sell at. This will tell you how much money per month you are saving (or losing) per month compared to your Personal monthly \u0026ldquo;rent\u0026rdquo;.

A few other price categories showed easing: Appliance prices are coming down, along with sporting goods, men’s clothing, car rentals and hotel rates. Airfares dropped because of lower fuel costs, and used-car prices edged down. All of these were enough to bring down non-energy, non-food price increases to a moderate level in July.\nThis led to a very high rate of almost 10% for Series I Savings Bonds. This is amazing for a bond and seems like a no-brainer buy. However, there are some caveats:\nThe bond cannot be sold for 1 year. If sold before 5 years, you lose the last 3 months of interest. You must pay income tax on earnings when the bonds are sold. The rate is reindexed to inflation every 6 months, so this return will only come as long as inflation is high. Kiplinger again:\nInflation is not done yet. Prices continued to rise strongly for basics such as food, rent and new vehicles. There is some evidence that food prices may be moderating after a year’s worth of large monthly increases. But continuing large wage increases at many businesses are likely to keep upward pressure on most prices for some time to come. Expect price inflation at the end of the year to be around 8.0%, down a bit from the peak of 9.1% in June, but still high. Inflation will likely fall to around 3%-4% by the end of next year if the economy slows, as expected.\nFrom the OECD:\nSo it looks like if I buy these bonds now I will probably get a year out of them before I will want to go back into the stock market. With income tax on earnings plus the 3 month interest payback, I\u0026rsquo;m likely looking at a return of 9.6% for 6 months, then 7% for 6 months, then 0% for 3 months (because I lose the last 3 months), or 6.64% interest. After a ~35% tax (I expect to sell the rest of my investments only when my income and therefore tax rate is much lower), this ends up being 4.32%.\nThis is much better than the 0% rate I am getting on the $5-10k I keep in my bank account (I know, I live dangerously\u0026hellip;), but at the cost of liquidity, especially for the first year. It\u0026rsquo;s not really an emergency fund if you can\u0026rsquo;t withdraw it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not convinced that this rate will beat the stock market overall in the next year though.\nSo if I\u0026rsquo;m not using the bonds as an emergency fund, it comes down to: do I think that the market will grow less than ~4.5% in the next year? For me the answer is no right now.\nContext # https://totalrealreturns.com/ gives a good visualization of returns and volatility for different investments.\nStock options # Excellent Reference The Value Factor # Investment returns can theoretically be explained by different factors described here.

If you\u0026rsquo;ve held the stock for \u0026lt; 1 year, it is taxed as ordinary income; otherwise it is taxed at a lower capital gains rate. This Motley Fool page has a good explanation with examples.\nNote that your capital gains themselves help determine your capital gains tax rate. If you make no ordinary income, but sell stock resulting in a $1 million gain, your income for the purposes of determining your capital gains tax rate will be $1 million. You will not pay ordinary income tax on this amount, but instead the 20% (in 2021) capital gains tax rate for this income level.\nIf you are making significant capital gains over the year and are not offsetting this amount by for example having your employer withhold more tax, you must pay taxes quarterly to the IRS here.

Here are my responses to their survey on March 28, 2025:\nHow did you first discover lifelogging, and how has it changed your day-to-day life?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember a specific event, but I slowly started finding myself aware that many events/experiences in my life were very ephemeral. They would happen and then be forgotten; I would have nothing to \u0026ldquo;show\u0026rdquo; for my time spent. Occasionally I would even notice myself repeating behaviors or attempting things that I had tried in the past and never learned from, leading to the same outcome.\nThis would often manifest when people asked me what I\u0026rsquo;d been up to lately, and I would struggle to respond coherently.\nI found both the ephemerality and forgetting very dissatisfying. It made me feel like my time spent was wasted, or at least not fully utiltized.\nI saw lifelogging as a way to make me feel better about this.\nGenerally speaking, my lifelogging has worked at achieving this goal. Now, when I\u0026rsquo;m curious, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier for me to go back in my logs and remember specific events, even those that have long passed.\nCould you describe your current lifelogging workflow? (Please cover: devices used, scenario selection, post-processing, data storage, and long-term use cases.)\nI currently use Mementodb on my phone and computer to log notable events that happen during the day. I usually log 1-3 events per day. Each log is a line or two of text, with some categorization tags and a general positive-negative rating of the event. I go back and read this log when I feel like it, and am consistently surprised by how well it sparks vivid memories of even long past events.\nI use my own tool https://github.com/kovasap/autojournal-on-gas to collect information from ActivityWatch running on my computers, and a location logging app on my phone, to pull information about what I\u0026rsquo;m up to into my Google calendar to a visual representation of my activity. It also sends me emails summarizing my Mementodb lifelog, and puts the events on my calendar as well. This tools runs automatically in the background via Google Apps Script. I have been actively using this tool less in recent times, but occasionally I\u0026rsquo;ll look at the calendar to remember stuff. Unfortunately, my computer logging has recently broken and I haven\u0026rsquo;t been motivated to fix it (it\u0026rsquo;s probably a simple issue).\nI have a program regularly take screenshots of my computer screen and upload them to Google photos. This is described at https://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file#automatic-screenshooting.\nI have a recurring reminder on my phone to take a picture of the real world, which is then stored in google photos.\nMy \u0026ldquo;Daily Habits\u0026rdquo; page should have an up to date \u0026ldquo;lifelogging\u0026rdquo; section that may change in the future with what I actually do. I never plan to update this page (it is a snapshot).\nWhat is the biggest challenge you face in your lifelogging process? How do you currently handle it?\nOne of the biggest challenges I did face was motivating myself to do manual logging. My big breakthrough was to focus on logging the things that made me feel most passionate and treat the logging as a conversation with another person (and only log things I felt were worth sharing with that hypothetical person). With this perspective, logging is much easier now.\nI tried rolling my own automatic camera lifelogging system), but managing the mass volume of data from the camera was too hard. The Narrative Clip, which I tried afterward, was amazingly better. Too bad they shut the service down or I would be still using it.\nI was also very motivated for a time to find a way to have a microphone record me at all times and translate all the conversations I had to a text \u0026ldquo;script\u0026rdquo;. I could never figure out how to technically accomplish this, but would be super excited to try a solution here. I feel that lifelogging can have a data volume problem, but a simple text script of your day I think would be very easy to read/digest/postprocess compared to other forms of lifelogging data.\nDo you have any memorable lifelogging-related stories you’d like to share with us?\nNot specifics, but as stated earlier I am consistently amazed at how vivid the memories my lifelog triggers can be, even of very old events.\nWe’ve designed a lifelogging device with the following specs:\nWeight: ~30g (wearable/clippable) Features: Interval photo/video, audio recording. etc Battery life: ~2 days AI integration: Auto-categorization \u0026amp; video clipping Would you be willing to use this product? Do you see any potential shortcomings?\nYes definitely!\nI worry that the data generated will need to be stored somewhere, which will lead to a monthly subscription fee requirement. I would much rather have an option to aggressively cull data, pay a larger upfront fee, or manage my own data somehow than need to pay a subscription.\nWhich features interest you most, or features you want that we didn\u0026rsquo;t provide?\nAs noted above, if you can do speech-to-text and output a script of each day from the microphone that would be amazing!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s your top concern regarding this product/system?

Some examples of things that would be nice to remember more accurately: The ideas in an engaging conversation The places I was in the last day where I should look for my missing keys The stuff I did during the last week when trying to figure out what projects to continue working on. The stuff I did over the last weekend when someone asks \u0026ldquo;how was your weekend?\u0026rdquo;. Finding correlations in, or otherwise analyzing, lifelogging data could lead to clear insights about which behaviors lead to better health, more desirable states of mind, and better life outcomes however you want to define them. See my Tracking Health page for more details. An Ideal System # The primary issue with lifelogging is that collecting even small amounts of information consistently can be very time consuming. This is exacerbated if you are not running a specific experiment on yourself that requires very targeted collection, but are rather trying to paint a picture of your life that could be used for more generic analysis and memory-aiding.\nTherefore, my ideal lifelogging system would be totally automatic. This could be achieved with the following components:\nA GPS monitor logging my location. Done using GPSLogger Tracking food consumption via photos. Done using autojournal + Google Photos. Plan to move to MomentoDB for this. A wearable camera that sees what I see and stores the video somewhere. Partially done using a snapcam A wearable microphone that hears what I hear, and transcribes all heard speech to a searchable text log, like a script to the play that is my life. Not done yet, see https://roberdam.com/en/wisper.html (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33608437) for prior art! Programs that log what I\u0026rsquo;m doing on my various devices (laptop, phone, etc.). Almost done with ActivityWatch. Previously/currently done with selfspy. Tracking Exercise Should be inferrable from my location tracking, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t written the logic yet. Tracking habit adherence. Like exercise or practicing a skill. I found proactively assigning myself to do a habit at a specific time works very well, and this has the added benefit of tracking when I tick off my assignment as \u0026ldquo;done\u0026rdquo;. I use Google Tasks for this, which show up on my Google Calendar. Ideally I would write code to save my task data so that it could be visualized in other places (and so deleted tasks wouldn\u0026rsquo;t disappear from history). Various sensors that track mood and health metrics. Manually done with MomentoDB, therefore not consistent :/ Previously done with Nomie, which IMO is strictly worse than MomentoDB. Logic that tries to infer meaningful \u0026ldquo;events\u0026rdquo; from the datastreams collected by these components. For example, image processing software analyzing my camera feed coupled with GPS data could infer that I was playing soccer from 1-2pm on Saturday. Not done yet A place to store all the collected data. Done with Google Drive A calendar or timeline -like visualization system that provides a scrollable, searchable way to browse all the generated life events. Partially done with autojournal. See continuous glucose monitoring experiment for a timeline view. A tool that can find correlations in the stored data and in general condense it down to insights. Preferably this would be folded into the calendar or timeline visualization. Partially done with biomarker correlator An example of what this looks like can be found at https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/calendar/ (not my system exactly, but very similar).\nCurrently Available Tools # This table summarizes the functionalities of different software tools I\u0026rsquo;ve tried for personal data tracking.

This can happen even if you are improving because of variance intrinsic to your activity, or others improving faster than you.\nOne thing that helps me manage this is reflecting on the fact that human ability is generally very multidimensional and impacted by many different variables. This philosophy is already commonly applied to many activities along some axes like gender, weight class. However, there are many other dimensions that impact performance:\nClothing/shoe choice Drug use Diet composition Supplement use Technique Genetics Age Experience These dimensions could just as well be used to stratify people into competitive groups. When I start thinking about optimizing myself along all these dimensions, I find that my competitive frustration dampens. I find that usually I\u0026rsquo;m internally only trying to compete on a few dimensions, like willpower. If I could just take drugs or tune some of these other parameters to improve my performance, I would feel less satisfied that if I improved via the dimensions I care about.\nThe fact that others can outperform me via these dimensions I don\u0026rsquo;t care as much about makes me feel less bad about being outperformed. In fact, sometimes I take pride in my performance in spite of my weakness in dimensions I don\u0026rsquo;t care about. For example, my ability to (rock) climb routes of a given grade with the handicap of ratty shoes makes me feel stronger that I would otherwise. I also feel great when I have early (\u0026ldquo;beginner\u0026rsquo;s luck\u0026rdquo;-y) strong performance in an activity with the handicap of lack of experience.\n"},{"id":157,"href":"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/bike-commuting/","title":"Bike Commuting","section":"Docs","content":" Bike Commuting # Benefits # Exercise. Moving your body is good for you, especially when regularly done. If you have to go to work every day, it makes sense to couple that mandatory travel with exercise to make the exercise \u0026ldquo;mandatory\u0026rdquo; itself! Inexpensive. Especially if you buy cheap bikes, bike commuting might be the least expensive way to travel around a city short of walking. On your own terms. For me, it\u0026rsquo;s important to be on my own schedule and not have to worry about public transportation schedules and parking time limits. Biking is not the only way to accomplish this, but it does a good job at it. Downsides # Requires living in an area where everyday needs (work, grocery, etc.) are close by. Living in these areas is usually more expensive. This is not really a con if you want to live in these areas for other reasons. If you do not have a car, then it can be logistically harder to participate in certain activities, which will probably end up with you simply not doing them consistently. Listening while Biking # I highly recommend listening to audiobooks or podcasts when biking to both be entertained and maybe learn some stuff or get inspired while you\u0026rsquo;re at it.\nI used to do this by putting some large studio-style over-ear headphones over my helmet so that the speakers would not sit on my ears, but rather a couple inches away from them. This worked pretty well, although it did look kinda silly.\nSince then I\u0026rsquo;ve switch to using \u0026ldquo;bone-conduction\u0026rdquo; headphones like these (I can\u0026rsquo;t find my originally purchased ones). In my experience, these just act like tiny speakers that are close to your ears, but not in them - I don\u0026rsquo;t get much \u0026ldquo;bone-conduction\u0026rdquo; effect from my pair.\nHowever you listen when biking, I highly recommend making sure you can still hear what\u0026rsquo;s going on around you for safety.\nBuying a Bike # I personally recommend buying a cheap, used bike for commuting. There are several reasons for this:\nMaintaining an expensive bike\u0026rsquo;s high performance can itself be expensive and time consuming, especially if you ride it a lot, which you would be doing if you are commuting. A cheaper bike with worse performance will require less maintenance to keep it at its current performance level, and you can even just let it fall into disrepair and get another cheap bike when it becomes unusable. This makes the assumption that performance for commuting is not that important (it isn\u0026rsquo;t for me). It\u0026rsquo;s easier to buy multiple bikes if they are cheap, which has several benefits: You can try out different styles of bike and/or bikes with different features over a longer time window. If one bike has a problem that might take a couple days to resolve (e.g. if you are waiting for a part delivery), you still have a bike to use. Bike theft is a real problem, and having a used bike (1) makes your bike a less attractive target for thieves and (2) makes any theft that does occur less painful. AFAIK no lock perfectly secures your bike, and few/no locks secure individual bike components. In a big city like Seattle, there are a lot of people selling bikes, so they are usually pretty easy to find. I use craigslist and Facebook Marketplace for this.\nModifications # Milk Crate # The best way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to transport stuff on a bike is a back rack + milk crate combo:\nThis securely holds things that are just placed in it (like a backpack). Previously I used straps to secure bags to the bike rack itself, but this is much easier. This is also much more pleasant than actually wearing a backpack when biking, especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to sweat too much.\nRainy Weather # One of the worst parts of bike commuting is getting wet on the way in to work and not being able to dry off. For me, most of my cloths dry pretty quickly in the generally light Seattle rain, but my shoes and socks do not. This is partially because of their relative thickness and also because they are usually exposed to the most water. Even when it is not actively raining, biking on wet ground can toss up a good amount of water on- or into my shoes.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found the best solution to this problem by far is wearing some kind of waterproof shoe covers like these.\nMaintenance # Most bike maintenance is not that hard to learn, and you will save lots of time and money in the long run if you learn some basics. Here I list the most common problems that can be easily addressed DIY. Check out YouTube for good tutorials if I haven\u0026rsquo;t linked any myself.\nMost repairs require some specialized tools, which are pretty cheap on Amazon (usually less expensive than having the repair done professionally once).\nA good site for learning more is https://www.sheldonbrown.com.\nFlat Tires # I like to keep a couple tubes (like this one) around for an easy change. I also use patch kits for small punctures.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll also need tire levers to remove your tire.\nWhen changing a tube, keep in mind that your tube was damaged by something. This could be:\nSomething that punctured your tire. Run your hands along the inside of your tire near the puncture to make sure that nothing sharp is still embedded in your tire! Your tire itself has a hole in it. Your tube folded as it inflated, or was otherwise pinched. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to change your tube only to have your new tube break for the same reason!\nSkipping Gears # Sometimes when you bike you may notice skipping when pedaling, especially when pedaling hard. This is usually quite jarring and in bad cases can make your bike fairly unridable. This issue can be caused by several different problems:\n1. Misaligned Shifters # Your gear shifters may put the chain in between two of the cogs that it wraps around. To fix this, usually shifters can be shifted around by tighting or loosening a screw on them.\n2. A Stretched Chain # Over time, bike chains stretch. An overly stretched chain can lead to skipping, as the distance between the links no longer properly matches the distances between the teeth on the cog. See https://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/when-to-replace-a-chain-on-a-bicycle for a good overview of this problem.\nTIP: When replacing the chain, sometimes using a chain tool to drive the cylindrical bit through the two links to close the loop will result in a \u0026ldquo;stiff\u0026rdquo; link. Basically the two links of the chain on either side of the bit you just drove through will not rotate freely along the bit like the other links. One common reason this happens is because the pressure from driving the bit will press the outer link firming against the inner one. To fix this, simply put some metal pliers or the like into the gap between the two outer link\u0026rsquo;s sides and twist to push the sides further apart!\n3. Worn Cogs # Just like chains can wear out, so can the cogs they wrap around. This happens more slowly, and I\u0026rsquo;ve heard can be slowed even further by regularly replacing your chain (presumably stretched chains wear out cogs faster). When a cog is worn, skipping occurs for the same reason as when a chain is worn - there is a misfit between the chain and the cog. Cogs can also break teeth, making this even worse!\nNote when replacing cogs that there are two types, freewheels and cassettes. It is crucial to know which one you have before attempting a replacement! Check out these sites for more details:\nhttps://www.sheldonbrown.com/free-k7.html https://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/determining-cassette-freewheel-type I\u0026rsquo;ve made the mistake before of trying to replace the wrong type of cog, and it\u0026rsquo;s not fun.\nStuck Seatpost # I had a very persistent problem for a while of my seatpost being stuck in a specific position on one of my bikes. I think the root cause was corrosion fusing the post to the frame, but am not completely sure. I tried very hard for a long time to fix this, as the seat was slightly too high and I suspect this was causing me pain in my left knee. Eventually, a coworker lent me a pipe wrench and I bought some penetrating lube. These two in tandem easily loosened my seatpost!\nNote that any links to products on this page are Amazon affiliate links.\n"},{"id":158,"href":"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/daily-habits/","title":"Daily Habits","section":"Docs","content":" Daily Habits # Food # See Personal Food Habits.\nSupplements # See Supplements.\nExercise # When using a computer # I try to move around regularly, via walking around or doing some light physical-therapy-style exercises like https://www.momentumphysicaltherapy.ca/blog/okotoks-physiotherapy-posture-exercises.\nTasks # All things I need to do should be tracked in a \u0026ldquo;reminders\u0026rdquo; task list in Google Tasks with an associated date/time.

Specifically, it took me a while to get used to the fact that some part of the keyboard took way longer to heat up than others when soldering, and I often applied solder too early while the metal was still too cold, leading to an ugly connection.\nSome of my connections worked right after soldering, but failed after a couple hours exposed to colder temps.\nMidway through the build, here I was trying to decide if I should use the large sockets available at my makerspace, or solder directly onto the board. Luckily I was able to find shorter sockets from a coworker that gave me the best of both worlds.\nFinal Product # Keymap # https://github.com/kovasap/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/kaly/kaly42/keymaps/kovasap/keymap.c\nLintilla # Motivation # After using my Kaly42 for a while, there were some minor issues that were consistenly annoying me. I detailed these issues at https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1i6q9ih/searching_for_keyboard_42_key_split_staggered/. A commenter helpfully suggested the Lintilla keyboard, which looked to solve all of my problems, plus add some nice new features like being wireless.\nBuild Process # The instructions on the Lintilla GitHub page for getting parts and building the board were phenomenal. In no small part due to the high quality instructions, building the Lintilla was just as easy or easier than building the Kaly42 despite being a more complex board.\nI did run into a couple hiccups that might be useful for others to know:\nFinding the M2 screws and hex nuts was surprisingly difficult in my local area. The hardware stores I tried only had down to M3. I ended up ordering many more than I needed from Amazon. Ordering the Xiao microcontrollers from Seeedstudio in China took 30 days to deliver. Maybe I just got unluchy. At first I put the microcontrollers on both sides of the board backwards. One of them I removed (and destroyed :( ) by grilling it on a hot plate. Luckily the other one I was able to save by removing it with a hot air gun. I had some other minor issues during the build that are documented at https://github.com/ctranstrum/lintilla/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Akovasap. The keyboard creator was extremely helpful in helping me work through these issues, and several of the issues led to repository updates that will solve the problems for future builders. Note how the microcontroller is incorrectly on the top of the board, whereas all the sockets/diodes are on the bottom!\nFinal Product # Except for the middle thumb key, the keycaps are colored by the finger that will use them.\nI tried out some \u0026ldquo;convex\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;thumb\u0026rdquo; keycaps on the thumb keys, and it is incredible how much more comfortable they are to use than the normal keycaps with the sharpish edges.\nMy finished Lintilla, with my Kaly42 behind it. I like using gloves as wrist rests, and have even attached some to my kaly with strings. These rests double as \u0026ldquo;cases\u0026rdquo; I can flip on top of the keycaps to protect them for transport when I put the keybord halves back-to-back. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably end up doing something similar for the Lintilla.\nKeymap # https://github.com/kovasap/zmk-config/blob/main/config/lintilla.keymap\nNormal Keyboard Usage # As much as I like my custom keyboards, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just more convenient to use my laptop keyboard.

Not only is it tiring, but I frequently fail at it; some of the tasks will just evaporate from my memory, only to be recalled a day later (or when there is a serious problem stemming from the task not being done). This isn\u0026rsquo;t helped by \u0026ldquo;trying harder\u0026rdquo;. Doing so only makes me \u0026ldquo;panic-remember\u0026rdquo; a task every 5 minutes or so, pulling me completely out of whatever else I was doing.\nTrying to remember tasks I\u0026rsquo;ve found also has a large negative impact on my sleep quality. The cycle of \u0026ldquo;panic-remembering\u0026rdquo; leads to me sleeping lightly and waking up whenever the remembering happens.\nMobile Reminders # An amazing solution to my above problem has been using reminders on my smartphone to keep tasks out of my head, but still make sure they are done. I personally use Google Tasks, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure other reminder apps would work just as well. My system works like this:\nThink of something that needs to be done, or be asked to do something by another person. Add a task on my phone with a description of the work. Set a time on the task when I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be free to tackle it. Get notified of the task at the time I set. Do the task, or postpone it; or do some work towards the task and postpone it for later follow up. This system works very well compared to e.g. a to-do list, because it explicitly considers what time I\u0026rsquo;ll be in the right mindset and have the right context to do each item. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to periodically scan my list and re-remember every task when figuring out what to do next.\nThis system also makes it easy to set recurring tasks, or tasks in the far future (months to years away). I\u0026rsquo;ve never been able to consistently remember to do these kinds of tasks before using this system.\nBuilding Habits # Setting recurring reminders at specific times is also an extremely effective way of building atomic habits.

Spending time untangling this web of interactions for oneself is a worthy endeavor that has personally helped me feel more consistently energetic. Also a deeper understanding of these interactions will probably make you live longer!\nVision: Vision is a clear path for how to achieve the goal in question, or at least for how to get closer to achieving said goal. Acquiring vision can be tricky and fickle. For me, it helps to:\nSomewhat aimlessly learn about the area of knowledge the goal is in by reading what other people have written/said about it. Sometimes reading about even completely unrelated topics can spark ideas about the original goal. Audiobooks and podcasts are great for getting this exposure. Plant \u0026ldquo;seeds\u0026rdquo; in my head relating to the goal. These usually manifest as questions I\u0026rsquo;m curious to know the answers to, or very rough theories that I can\u0026rsquo;t even put into words for how the goals might be achieved. Sleep on my knowledge to find new connections and/or grow the seeds (see Hammock Driven Development). Do cardiovascular exercise like hiking or running to find new connections and/or help grow the seeds. Not sure how this helps (more blood flow to the brain?), but it usually does for me. Take a long break from the goal and work on another goal. Having multiple in-flight projects at once makes this more natural. Set up my environment and habits so that I am consistently exposed to the goal, making it more likely my thoughts will wander to it and make progress decoding it. Spend time writing about how I might achive the goal, or make a more concrete plan on paper as I know more. This will help keep me on track once I get started doing tasks, and helps avoid the problem of finishing something then not knowing what to do next. See also creativity (maybe I should merge these sections). Wisdom # Wisdom to me means a relative lack of surprise with the behavior of the world around oneself. By this definition, to become wise is to build an effective model of the world in one\u0026rsquo;s head that can predict what will happen consistently, thus avoiding surprise. Because the world is often unpredictable, wisdom also means not expecting things of the world that cannot be expected. For example, there are many catastrophes that could happen at any moment, causing severe damage to one\u0026rsquo;s life - handling these with grace as opposed to feeling the negative emotions that come with unmet expectations is perhaps wise.\nThis is discussed in a lot more detail by Stoic philosophers. My reading of this work is that the universe behaves logically and the better one understands this universal reason (logos), the more in harmony with the universe one will be.\nWisdom also means recognizing that attaining accurate knowledge is often painstaking work, and therefore to be wise is to be patient with learning and not try to take shortcuts when understanding the truth is important. See What to believe for discussion of this.\nWisdom may be related to a well developed \u0026ldquo;System 1\u0026rdquo; as described in Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.\nOne danger with chasing wisdom is believing that all the time you\u0026rsquo;ve spend \u0026ldquo;getting wiser\u0026rdquo; by thinking justifies confident snap-opinions on new issues. Building models to understand the world requires abstraction, and abstract models never perfectly fit new concrete situations. In my opinion recognizing this limitation, and being willing to put in the work of describing and modelling the new situation is itself wise. This is highly related to the concept of Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Mind, which IMO it is wise to cultivate, as opposed to an \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rsquo;s mind\u0026rdquo;.\nRealizing that human knowledge is fallible, but also objectively meaningful and the accumulation of it makes one objectively wiser is discussed in detail in The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch.\nIn practice, wisdom naturally leads to well-roundedness:\nWell-Roundedness # Being well rounded to me means having a wide range of capabilities. This has several strong benefits:\nIt reduces single points of failure in life (e.g. injuries or big life changes leaving one without a purpose/focus). It makes moments where the world is negatively effecting one in a way which they are powerless to stop rarer, since it is more likely one will have the skills necessary to redirect or counter the negative effect. It makes you more socially interesting to a wider range of different people. People find capability in specific areas interesting, so more capability in more areas should make you more interesting to more people. It allows one to notice and act on more opportunities in life, since most require some knowledge in their area to detect and exploit. I think it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say that ones ability to discover and make the most of opportunities has massive impact on the trajectory of ones life. It hastens learning of new skills and concepts, which often have similarities to other skills/concepts. The more you have command of, the more likely it is that there will be commonalities between the new skill/concept and one you already know. Also, it can help build abstract mental concepts by consciously identifying these commonalities and storing them as a new abstract concept. It enables formation of novel ideas, which are often just ideas from one discipline applied to another. One way to describe this value is as an aspiration to being a \u0026ldquo;Renaissance man\u0026rdquo; (See ERE for more discussion of this.\nBecoming more well rounded is mostly achieved (in my experience) by seeing roadblocks in life as personal opportunities for growth. Energetically owning and tackling these roadblocks will lead to learning the best ways to get around them, improving one\u0026rsquo;s breath of knowledge and making similar issues one might encounter later easier to navigate.\nThe \u0026ldquo;I can do this\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I can learn how to do this\u0026rdquo; sentiment when faced with any issue should lead to an increase in well-roundedness over time.\nSome areas of knowledge to consider personally deeply understanding to become more well rounded + tasks to try:\nRepair/construction of objects you depend on - try fixing your computer/cloths/furniture/bike/car/house. Investing savings - try researching, creating, and executing a personal investment plan yourself. Food production - try growing/cooking your own food. See a barbell life for some related thoughts.\nCuriosity # The desire to explore novelty.\nIn Why Greatness Cannot be Planned, the authors discuss how large human advancements necessarily come from people exploring the unknown. I want to be the kind of person that makes doing this a habit. This has the side benefit of making life seem richer, as novelty leads to stronger memory formation.\nEmpowerment # To me, personal empowerment is about leveraging vigor and wisdom to achieve goals. Empowerment and motivation are near synonyms to me. Good environment and expectations dramatically help keep up motivation/empowerment.\nTODO: Merge this with motivation.\nEnvironment # A large chuck of my brain does things in response to environmental stimuli. If I see tasty food, part of my brain will want to eat it. If I am too hot or cold, part of my brain will make a fuss. If I\u0026rsquo;m with other people, part of my brain will want to impress or entertain them.\nBecause of this, crafting an environment that encourages healthy behaviors that help you achieve personal goals is really important. I agree with James Clear that it is foolish to think your conscious mind can muscle its way past all the other parts that manage environmental stimuli to reach its goals.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to get swept up in life and let your behavior be dictated by your environment (e.g. what others around you are doing).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s dangerous to do this since your environment is not a sentient being and therefore does not care about anything, let alone your personal happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth taking a step back and consciously running through whether you agree with your environment\u0026rsquo;s influence or not frequently. Otherwise you might end up less happy/satisfied/fulfilled than you might otherwise be.\nDoing this takes time and energy. Therefore, if you want to live more intentionally, it is important to give yourself that space/energy and not fill it with other things.\nOne common and strong environmental force is momentum. It is easier to continue doing something you are already doing than to switch tasks. This can be used to help complete less pleasurable tasks (finishing homework or a workout), but also can make you continue doing an activity past the point of it\u0026rsquo;s benefit to you. Examples of this for me include: eating after already full, playing a game to the point of frustration, and continuing to browse Reddit or YouTube without feeling inspired about what I find. Stopping and checking yourself in these situations with this idea in mind can help you switch tasks to something that will be a better overall use of time. I have a pet theory that your brain gets specifically tired with particular tasks after a couple hours of doing them, and switching at this point to another task often uses enough different parts of your brain to make you feel very fresh in the new context.\nExpectations # TODO: fill this in (potentially from the \u0026ldquo;motivation\u0026rdquo; doc)\n"},{"id":183,"href":"/docs/me/personal-drama/","title":"Personal Drama","section":"Docs","content":" Personal Drama # testing\n"},{"id":184,"href":"/docs/me/potential-life-missions/","title":"Potential Life Missions","section":"Docs","content":" Potential Life Missions # Finding a way to use my time and resources to make the world a better place is a goal of mine.

If we could make it so that the average person could effectively use their spare time to work on these big problems, and built a culture encouraging this, we could unlock a lot of latent creative power.\nWays to do this include:\nAdvertising Next Steps # Making more non-fiction content with a \u0026ldquo;current state of things\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;next steps\u0026rdquo; section that encourages individuals to experiment with the frontier.\nGiving People Time # Giving people more time/money to dig into problems, e.g. with UBI.\nhttps://justinmares.com/apply-for-an-trajectory-change-grant/ is an idea.\nBuilding a Problem-Accessible Culture # Building open (free to participate in) communities around societal issues.\nEducation # I think that having students in schools spend more time actually trying to tackle real problems, as opposed to working on contrived assignments might help empower more people. IMO school in general is too focused on giving students a strong base of pre-requisite knowledge. Many people (myself included) hold the sentiment that the most important thing they learned in school is \u0026ldquo;learning how to learn\u0026rdquo;, since much of the actual content they learned is not directly relevant to the problems they are trying to solve. Despite this, they are still by and large effectively solving those problems that they were not schooled to do. I think this is because people have a strong ability to pick up pre-requisites quickly when it is obvious why they need to know them given the problem at hand.\nTherefore, if we made school either much shorter, or gave students real problems to work on in a low-risk environment, this may lead to good outcomes.\nOptimism # I currently believe that optimism encourages action.

This could be into the air as speech, onto paper as writing, or into your body as any physical activity (e.g. dancing, biking, etc.). In this model, pure professing involves no self reflection or change whatsoever. If there is adaptation to the unpredictable physical world, it is through if/then branches that choose simply between already constructed neural patterns.\nBeing in this state requires some combination of practice or training to build the mental patterns, and a framework of assumptions that keeps the mind from examining what it is doing too closely.\nIn the extreme, pure profession can be animalistic and stubborn. Being in a professing state leads to confidence and strong ego.\nBeing in this state can be physically draining, but mentally I find I can be in this state for a long time before needing a break.\nPeople tend to express this state more the older they get (i think).\nFlow # Being in a strong professing state can lead to a \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo; state, where the world is continually validating your stored patterns and it feels like everything is going \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;. I believe this state enables the acts of greatest skill or talent that are possible for people. This is a state of “effortless effort” as described in Zen philosophy.\nI think the key to flow is to always have a readily accessible pathway for your mind to take when it runs into an issue. Preparation/practice builds these pathways; it is easier to get into flow doing something you have done many times before.\nAbsorbing - Learning - A State of Observation # In counter to profession, a state of absorption occurs when a mind is focused instead on taking in new information while making few/no assumptions about the world. In this state, instead of continually acting, one continually questions, expanding the problem space without looking at its details. This happens often when being exposed to new information or questioning assumptions one has about old information. New mental connections and memories are being created actively in this state.\nWhen in this state, a mind is very sensitive to any external feedback to correct its action. This can manifest as insecurity or anxiety if pressure is applied during this state of mind.\nThis state of mind can be paralyzing, as it lays bare the overwhelming complexity of everything as you continue to zoom out. However, it also leads to interesting connections that you may not see otherwise.\nExtreme absorption/mindfulness can lead to analysis paralysis or meaningless theorizing that is too far removed from reality to be useful. Also procrastination.\nYounger people tend to express this state more (i think). This thought inspired by “How to Change Your Mind” by Michael Pollan.\nBeing in this state is very draining, as your mind has to constantly reconfigure its thoughts reactively to match external feedback. For me to be most effective, I need to take short and long breaks from this state (even “sleeping on” what I’m learning) to solidify memories and make them “professable”. Too much raw absorption becomes counterproductive, as my mind is too tired to even hold on to the recent changes, let alone make more new ones.\nWhen learning in this state, there will almost always be blind alleys you must go down to eventually find a model of (or perspective on) the world that works. This explains why learning can be such a \u0026ldquo;stop and go\u0026rdquo; process - it\u0026rsquo;s easy to be stuck on a concept for a while before it finally clicks. Also I think one’s tolerance for blind alleys directly correlates to how good they are at learning.\nInversion by James Clear Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to succeed. Switching states # In order to get better at something, both absorbing AND professing are equally important often in alternating steps.\nSee this Skyline video for a description about how this process works for a game like Overwatch specifically.\nLearning how to do something new under pressure of your own or other’s expectations can be hard. Specifically, it is stressful to take mental pathways you have recently worked on as an absorber and apply them assuming they will work (with penalty for failure).\nSomeone who “thrives in ambiguity” is bold about applying untested pathways and has a low fear of failure - or has set expectations properly such that failure is not a big problem. Alternatively, this person is willing to take on perspectives and run with them even if there is a threat that their taken perspective does not match the perspective/expectations of others they are working with.\nIdeas to test # Do you actually have a worse memory for events that happened to you when in a professing state? Focus # This is unrelated to the above states of mind.\nOne way I think of focus is as getting buy in from your mind to fully engage in some work (mental or physical). Often the mind expects some pay off for doing this, since it takes energy and time to be fully engaged. This snippet by Jonathan Blow does a great job describing how focus can be disrupted (full interview).\nA good way to encourage focus is to set yourself up so that external “things I should also think about” are absent. For example:\nWriting thoughts down so that your brain doesn’t feel pressure to remember them (else they would be lost). Keeping your goals “in front” of you. This could mean laying out your workspace so that all that’s needed to do your task is at hand. This could mean keeping opponents in a game within your field of view. Being in a situation where you have to “turn your head around” physically or metaphorically to keep abreast can lead to breaks in focus. Putting walls up between yourself and other tasks, like by putting your phone in another room when trying to focus on something. Another useful idea is to try to enumerate the things you want to do before starting on them. If this list is written down (or even remembered), going back to it can be a stimulus that competes with other environmental distractions or thoughts. For instance, a common pattern I notice is (1) I complete a task, (2) I have to refocus on something else, (3) some random environmental stimulus grabs my focus (e.g. an email, article, chore). When I have a list of things I want to do, then those become part of the set of environmental stimuli, making it more likely that I do them instead of something else. This system is most effective when the list is very accessible; this could mean physically at hand, or recently created so it is fresh in your mind. It also helps to consciously pause right after stage (1) above (completing a task), instead of directly jumping to the next thing with little thought - this simple pause really helps your next task be intentional and not dictated by your environment.\n"},{"id":187,"href":"/docs/mind/behavior-change/","title":"Behavior Change","section":"Docs","content":" Behavior Change # Building new habits is really important to making permanent improvement to your life. Doing new things is hard though. One thing that helps me work through this is realizing that every new thing (no matter how trivial) is going to be difficult, and I\u0026rsquo;ll need to sculpt the pathways in my brain to make it easy.\nFor example, if I want to eat more potatoes, taking the time to conscientiously learn how to cook them quickly and efficiently will help me automatically cook them when I\u0026rsquo;m tired and just want to eat something.\n"},{"id":188,"href":"/docs/mind/brain-juice/","title":"Brain Juice","section":"Docs","content":" Brain Juice # I\u0026rsquo;m not sure exactly how, but I feel that my brain behaves similarly to my muscles in that it can tire on both short and long timescales when used. My mind feels tired after making lots of new connections (learning new things) and especially when critically re-validating my existing connections. It also feels tired when doing the same thing many times, even if that thing is a simple expression of a deeply ingrained skill.\n"},{"id":189,"href":"/docs/mind/contentment/","title":"Contentment","section":"Docs","content":" Contentment and Satisfaction # At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history.\nHeller responds,“Yes, but I have something he will never have — ENOUGH.”\nIn my experience, it is natural to want to make progress in your endevours. Some examples:\nGetting promoted in your job Reading more books about a certain topic Getting degrees Ranking up in an ELO system (like chess) Getting new belts in a martial art I think that the billionaire in the above quote perhaps had put his focus strongly on job performance, to the exclusion of other areas. It could be that this led him to fixate on that aspect of his life to satisfy the desire for progress, to the exclusion of other areas. This exclusion could have led to a vicious cycle where desire for progress -\u0026gt; more focus on the job -\u0026gt; less ability to satisfy design through other means -\u0026gt; etc. The killer piece here is that the billionaire\u0026rsquo;s job may very well give bad/shaky signals for when progress is made. Money is often just a number, and when it goes up it can not feel as impactful as anticipated.\nIf this theory is correct at all, then a way to avoid the above problem is to diversify your endevours, at least adding some that have clear progress marks you can feel satisfied about.\n"},{"id":190,"href":"/docs/mind/creativity/","title":"Creativity","section":"Docs","content":" Creativity # Constraining the Problem Space # One of the main enemies of creative work getting done is the \u0026ldquo;blank page\u0026rdquo; - the mental state of staring at a blank page and being paralyzed either with too many thoughts or no thoughts. One useful tool to avoid this is by constraining your problem space, sometimes dramatically. For instance, what if you could only fold the page and do nothing else? Suddenly, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier (for me at least) to start just doing something. This helps a lot with \u0026ldquo;Just Getting Started\u0026rdquo;.\nConstraining the problem space could also involve setting a hard deadline for finishing X in 30-60mins. This will often introduce an urgency that can help produce something.\nAnother idea along these lines is to intentionally try to come up with the dumbest solution/idea and start implementing it. Since you are intentionally trying to do a bad job, all the thinking and anxiety that comes when trying to do stuff right is removed, which may facilitate doing something which can later be polished.\nJust Getting Started # Once you get on the path of creation, the small choices you encounter will generally be much more manageable decisions, and through them something complex often emerges.\nRemixing # Our minds create new things by mixing the old together. A classic examination of this is Everything is a Remix.\nA corollary of this idea is that to be creative it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to expose yourself to many other ideas. In my opinion, art in any form is spectacularly useful here. One way to think about art is as an expression of (hopefully new) ideas specifically designed to appeal to human sensibilities - the perfect coupling of novelty with a mechanism to get it to stick in your head. Art is also great at encouraging engagement with the world, especially new parts of it.\nVision and Confidence # Being \u0026ldquo;Determinant\u0026rdquo; as described by Peter Thiel in You Are Not a Lottery Ticket may help with this.\nBeing Unreasonable # One (unpolished) thought I\u0026rsquo;ve had is that being \u0026ldquo;unreasonable\u0026rdquo; could help with creativity. By unreasonable, I mean not considering all possibilities, ignoring objectively better optimizations, and ignoring people\u0026rsquo;s good opinions when in the process of creating. I\u0026rsquo;ve found for myself that, although this consideration in theory makes for a better end result, it can fracture the strong focus on a vision that is required to make something at all. Or it can warp the vision into something that is \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo;, but actually different to the point where the original vision is unfulfilled in some way.\nSee Also # My thoughts on game development, which play with a lot of these ideas.

For example:\nEating unhealthy food Stealing money Falling into an addiction One way to avoid acting on desires is via willful deprivation, or consciously using willpower to force oneself to not act on the desire. This crucially assumes that the desire is immutable, and focusing solely on resisting it.\nAn alternative strategy is to question and try to change the desire itself. Many desires exist because of supporting beliefs. For example:\nUnhealthy food makes me happier (via taste) than healthy food. Money will make me happier. My addictive behavior is healthy and makes me happy. By poking and prodding at these underlying beliefs, I\u0026rsquo;ve personally found that my desires are more mutable than I originally thought.

My thoughts on several contexts in which the word is used are described here:\nAbility to Learn # Tests judging intelligence, or general mental ability, are used to decide whether students at all levels are capable of participating in certain educational activities. These activities include taking certain courses and being admitted into certain programs or schools.\nSocial Perception # People use intelligence to describe each other in a general way.\n"},{"id":193,"href":"/docs/mind/education/","title":"Education","section":"Docs","content":" Thoughts on Education # Education as a Certification # One problem educational system have is that they force students to sit through classes that are boring because the students either already know the material or are not compatible with the pace of the class (too fast or too slow). If systems independently let students test out of courses, or offered testing separately from training, this problem might be solved to some extent. Of course, in this case the testing would have to be very good, and some things are unfortunately hard to test for. Project-based evaluation might be a good way around this.\nSee https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/cs-degree/ for a great story about what a test-driven education could look like for a motivated individual.\nHigh School as Survey # In my opinion, (at least my) high school education focused too much on fulfilling prerequisites and teaching fundamental topics and too little on surveying possible areas of study and career paths. I believe this is due to the assumption that prerequisites are necessary for students to be able to study higher level concepts (e.g. algebra before calculus before physics). While this is strictly speaking true, it ignores the power of motivating context. By this I mean that if you want to learn how a ball moves through space in physics, it is very obvious how calculus is helpful towards achieving your goal. However, if you are just learning calculus (or algebra!) without this context, it can feel like what you are learning is pointless (because it is to you at that moment).\nTrying to learn complex topics without understanding why they are useful is extremely difficult and leads to less memory retention of the things you learned if you end up do learning them. IMO this is one of the primary reason many people struggle in school. Conversely, if you DO have a strong reason to learn something, it is much easier to do so, and you may be able to pack much more learning into a shorter period of time. Plus, the learning will be more useful, as it is already shown to have at least the one motivating use.\nNot only can focus on hierarchical prerequisites stifle learning rate, it also does a disservice to students who are trying to figure out what to specialize in at college (if they attend) and in their careers. I personally knew a lot of abstract concepts in high school, and knew I was interested in STEM, but had pretty much no conception of the different types of STEM careers available to me and what kinds of day-to-day work they each would entail. If half the time spent in high school on academic classes was instead spent on career/field survey talks/activities/classes, I would have been much better prepared to set myself up for a fulfilling life after graduation, and I would have been more motivated to independently study those careers/fields.\nAs it stands, I feel like I got extremely lucky to land in the jobs I did. I very nearly joined a PhD program after college that in retrospect I\u0026rsquo;m quite certain I would have liked less than the companies I randomly was exposed to in my last years in college. It scares me that the only thing that saved me from this misstep was a random email on a mailing list I randomly joined, as opposed to something built into the educational system.\nExtended Education Concept # In high school and college I often felt extremely mentally busy. I was usually in 5+ hours a day of classes teaching radically different things. Synthesizing and remembering everything I was taught was difficult, and I fear that many of those hours were wasted simply because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the mental bandwidth to get all the information to stick.\nPost-college, I feel like I have much more mental bandwidth for learning. I\u0026rsquo;m well able to fill this with books, podcasts, and other online resources. Despite this, I sometimes wonder if generally speaking formal education could do a better job of utilizing mental bandwidth over time. By this I mean \u0026ldquo;hybridizing\u0026rdquo; college and other pursuits more than they already are.\nFor example, instead of being a full time vocation, college could instead involving taking 1 class per quarter/semester and spending the rest of one\u0026rsquo;s time working or doing whatever else you would otherwise do post-graduation. This would lead to college taking longer to provide the same level of education.\nThis could cause problems for people who want to start a skill-requiring job as soon as possible. I wonder if it\u0026rsquo;s possible to front-load practical prerequisites early in the education cycle for such jobs. In my experience in technical fields so far, there are only a few requirements I\u0026rsquo;ve truly needed from my education; otherwise most of my skills have been learned on the job.\nHigher Education # Interesting Article: https://annehelen.substack.com/p/is-everything-an-mlm?s=r\nLetter to my past (middle/high school) self # You are a person. As such you have the power to be creative and to change the world around you. Using this power is what you will spend the majority of your life doing.\nYou can use this power as an individual but most likely you\u0026rsquo;ll be working with other people in organizations to use your power together to achieve larger goals. Some examples of using your power individually include writing or creating any kind of content to be consumed by others on your own, or creating whole projects on your own perhaps tools for other people to use etc.\nThe world is full of big and small organizations of people trying to use their power together to make change. Some examples include companies, large and small, governments, research labs, universities, schools.\nWhen joining an organization it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand who funds the organization and why and what you can stand to benefit from joining said organization, both in terms of the force multiplier on your power to change the world and how much you\u0026rsquo;ll be compensated for joining that organization specifically.\nThere should be a school course that explores each one of these types of organizations in turn and discusses key features of that organization type and why you might want to be a part of it - and how you could be a part of it; what it takes to join and then rank up in said organization.\nFor example I have no idea what it takes to become someone who works on government policy as a full-time job. Or what the concerns of people doing this job are for instance with respect to their compensation or job security.\n"},{"id":194,"href":"/docs/mind/friendship/","title":"Friendship","section":"Docs","content":" Friendship # One way to look at a friend is as someone who cares about your in-the-moment emotional state, and wants to participate in improving it.

Doing hard tasks requires learning.\nhttp://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/\nOne way to model a task is as a tree of possibilities, where each node is a decision with any number of possible outcomes. Here I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss tasks that are hand because this tree is complex (has many nodes). Tasks can be hard for other reasons (e.g. physically hard), but I wont discuss those here.\nTask trees can have many nodes because:\nThere simply are many steps to take to complete the task, Because some steps in the process are committing, making it so that you need to try to predict a lot of the future decisions that will come up in order to be confident in your decision (like playing a game of chess), What Makes Tasks Easy? # Tasks are easy when a pathway has already been constructed in your head to execute that task effectively (traverse the tree of decisions in a predetermined way).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to be cautious of tasks that you find to be easy. In my experience it\u0026rsquo;s a human tendency to strongly defend the solutions to the tasks that one holds (see a reddit post about political beliefs and Claire\u0026rsquo;s old lab\u0026rsquo;s observation that ideas/theories can become \u0026ldquo;precious\u0026rdquo; once created). This makes sense, since it takes effort/time/resources to create a task-solving pathway. See also David Eagleman\u0026rsquo;s neuroscience books, which talk about this. However, this strong defense can blind one to obvious flaws or much better pathways. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a good habit to occasionally re-learn from scratch originally hard tasks that are important to do well.\nHard Task Solving Strategies - How to Learn # Learning requires active exploration of the real world task tree for the task you want to learn to do. Through this exploration, the tree is transcribed from the real world into mental pathways. So one way to think about learning hard tasks is learning how to most efficiently explore/transcribe the task tree.\nQuestions # Some parts of the task tree may already exist in your brain from another task you\u0026rsquo;ve done - for example, most of the muscle movement mental pathways needed to run already exist in someone who knows how to walk. Other parts may be completely new, or even contradictory to existing mental pathways. A very efficient way to more quickly learn these alien pathways is to question them via:\nAsking a task expert Asking a reference (e.g. A book or Google search) Tinkering with the task space (e.g. Attempting to run some computer code) Environmental Influence # The human brain constantly absorbs new information from its perspective on the environment where it is. For learning therefore, it can be helpful to place oneself in an environment conducive to learning what you want to learn.

He writes that exposing oneself to many decision points and giving oneself the option to travel will long term find one the most success.\nMental Perspective # The brain only understands the world as it perceives it through the senses. Although the senses can take in a high volume of information, there is still heavy processing that must be done for this information to be useful/actionable by the rest of the brain. There are many points along this chain of processing where learned perspective shapes what the rest of the brain sees. For instance, an image of an engine may just look like metal to an untrained brain, but tells a very different story to a mechanic.\nIn a way, learning or training is partially (or completely?) the process of acquiring new perspectives from which to see the world. This explains why learning can be such a \u0026ldquo;stop and go\u0026rdquo; process - it\u0026rsquo;s easy to be stuck on a concept for a while before it finally clicks.\nInversion by James Clear Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to succeed.

I would love to be shown that any of this is wrong!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think that intelligence is a useful concept, and don\u0026rsquo;t think that some kind of \u0026ldquo;general intelligence\u0026rdquo; (e.g. IQ) even exists in the way it\u0026rsquo;s commonly invoked (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Alex is more intelligent than Tom\u0026rdquo;).\nMy main critique is that the human brain is very context/domain specific in it\u0026rsquo;s ability. A good analogy is athleticism. Sumo wrestlers, sprinters, archers, and football players can all be considered \u0026ldquo;athletic\u0026rdquo;, but their talents are all scoped very narrowly to their respective sports. I would argue that the brain is like this, but x100. Would a talented typist be considered more \u0026ldquo;intelligent\u0026rdquo; than someone good at solving sudoku puzzles? Is someone good at solving the problems posed in IQ tests more \u0026ldquo;intelligent\u0026rdquo; than a creative scientist? Trying to make these comparisons is, in my opinion, silly.\nOne interesting thought is that maybe intelligence can be defined as the ease at which new skills can be learned? I would argue that this is also very domain specific. Also this would imply that newborn infants are very intelligent, which runs counter to our intuitions about the word.\nAlternatively, maybe intelligence is the number of skills one is proficient in? This seems more reasonable, but still has major flaws. For one, how would difficulty of skills be considered, if at all?\nSome skills, like \u0026ldquo;reasoning\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;deduction\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;argument\u0026rdquo; seem like they should be proxies for intelligence. I think skills like this can be learned like many others, and are built by etching heuristics and patterns into your brain.\nRelevant note: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38509399\n"},{"id":198,"href":"/docs/mind/meditation/","title":"Meditation","section":"Docs","content":" Meditation # Descriptions # Vipassana "},{"id":199,"href":"/docs/mind/motivation/","title":"Motivation","section":"Docs","content":" Motivation # NOTE This is a random theory of mine; don\u0026rsquo;t put too much stock into it!\nMotivation to do something requires that the \u0026ldquo;something\u0026rdquo; is attainable and meaningful (has a point/purpose).\n(Perceived) Attainability # Objectives that are perceived - which is really all that matters with respect to motivation - to be attainable have a trivially easy to accomplish next step on the path toward them.\nWhat makes a next step trivially easy? If your body/mind are primed to do the task such that you could do it with minimal/no conscious intervention. For example walking, reading, or doing some trained skill are trivially easy. Note that this depends on the current state of your body; walking may not be trivially easy if you are exhausted or have a broken leg. And also the state of your mind; responding to a conversation may be hard if you haven\u0026rsquo;t caught up on what has been said.\nNote that the whole path to the objective does not have to be trivially easy or even known. All that matters where motivation is concerned is the next step (at least for attainability).\nMotivation can flag when the next step towards a goal is unclear. In such situations it\u0026rsquo;s easy to simply switch gears to another activity which has clear steps - this is procrastination.\nHow to make things attainable # When something feels unattainable because either (a) it seems so hard you would fail if you tried or (b) its unclear what step to take next, I have found several tricks that work pretty well:\nThinking Creatively # See thoughts on creativity.\nTaking a Step Back # Taking a step back both from the problem at hand AND from anything else that engages your mind. The goal here is to put yourself in a state of boredom, then slightly nudge your thoughts toward your issue. Often I find my mind much more eagerly thinks about something when the prospect of boredom is there as an alternative. One way to do this is by going and sitting in another chair far from distractions.\nAnother alternative is going for a walk or run, preferably with no audio or other distractions. This method also usually engages my creativity, which helps open up new potential paths to issue resolution. There is the drawback that sometimes here my creativity will wander, and I will end up with good ideas about something other than my issue.\nTalking it Out # Talk to someone (or yourself) about the issue. Sometimes the act of putting your issue into works can snap some clarity into it. The person you are talking to may also offer useful insights. Writing thoughts down can also sometimes work here, if no-one is available to talk to.\nThis usually involves re-verifying the assumptions you\u0026rsquo;ve been making about the problem.\nGetting Psyched Up # This only applies when you find the task hard, but you see the path you would take to do it. In this case, for me listening to energetic music or putting myself in an energetic, stimulating, or even stressful environment (e.g. with other people around) can help me feel more active and therefore more able to do my hard task. I think part of this is that the stimulation occupies the higher level part of my mind that\u0026rsquo;s telling me the task is hard, and just lets the less conscious parts of me simply execute. Again, this only works for a case (a) above, not when it\u0026rsquo;s unclear what to do next. See the book \u0026ldquo;Antifragile\u0026rdquo; for more on this, specifically Book 1 Chapter 2.\nMaking Concrete Sub-Tasks # One highly effective way to keep something consistently attainable is to break it into smaller, concrete pieces that are each attainable even to a tired or distracted mind. The actual act of doing this can be very difficult, so this isn\u0026rsquo;t a great solution when you are already finding your motivation flagging. This strategy shines when you let your past self do this for you when it is energized and fresh. Of course, your past self wont have the direct motivation to do this (as it\u0026rsquo;s doing fine) so it helps to set reminders for yourself to do this work when you are fresh.\nTODO add a reference to the manifesto \u0026ldquo;vision\u0026rdquo; section here, or merge the sections # How to make things LESS attainable # When stuck on attainability, there are several counterproductive strategies:\nEating food in hopes that it will give you energy to push through. This always just makes me MORE tired especially in the short term. Plus I usually feel more able/energetic when I am slightly hungry.\nTrying to brute force your way through an issue without trying alternate routes. This sometimes works, but usually just makes me feel stupid and can lead to a vicious cycle where I continually burn more and more energy in less and less well directed ways trying to prove I am not stupid :). The key to avoiding this is making sure you aren\u0026rsquo;t following the same lines of thought over and over, and stopping if you find yourself doing so.\nThe tendency to try to brute force I find is more and more temping the most tired you are. One way to explain this is that as you do something hard (that you don\u0026rsquo;t already have mental circuits to handle) , your mind contracts/focuses on the problem until it becomes so rigid that even the slightest unexpected event (or new solution idea) is hard to handle. This is counter to an \u0026ldquo;expanded\u0026rdquo; mind where many possibilities are open and easy to handle. If you have been focusing hard on one thing, a way to expand your mind is to do something you might find boring and let your mind wander its way to expansion. As discussed earlier, going for a walk or otherwise exercising I find hastens this process. So going for a walk with no stimulation (no reading on phone, no listening to anything, no conversations with people) is a great technique. Some of this is inspired by the last part of Chapter 5 of \u0026ldquo;How to Change Your Mind\u0026rdquo; by Michael Pollan.\n(Perceived) Meaning # I find that discussing things with other people, especially if those other people care about those things (want them to happen), imbues a lot of meaning to them.\nActivities are also meaningful when they fit neatly into a larger narrative. This could be a grand narrative about one\u0026rsquo;s identity (e.g. defined by what virtues you aspire to or possess), or a myopic narrative about what puzzle piece should fit next into the puzzle to bring it closer to solution.\nWhat you or others may find meaningful in a certain situation varies a lot for many reasons. I have found myself obsessed with completing certain goals, and then having my obsession and motivation completely evaporate after reframing the larger context those goals fit into.\nOne way to lose motivation for a task is to follow the meaning of the task up through all the ways it impacts the world, coming to the final conclusion that there is no greater meaning in the world (or you don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is), and therefore the task itself is meaningless. This kind of \u0026ldquo;bubbling up\u0026rdquo; can happen on a smaller scale as well.\nTODO explore ideas from https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-learn-faster-when-we-arent-told-what-choices-to-make/\nThere are many sources of meaning (just see the above linked virtues list). Some of the sources that are strong for me personally:\nMaking something complicated, or hard to think about, clear. This could mean writing a good description or coming up with a good diagram/model. For example: https://ciechanow.ski/gps/. One of the main reasons this is so important is that it breeds motivation for you and others to work on the complicated thing. Building a tool that makes a task someone does regularly much easier. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how well the tool is built, just that it works. Proving competence. This involves demonstrating to myself and others that I can overcome difficult challenges. What the challenge actually is isn\u0026rsquo;t really that important, only that I can succeed at it where others (including my past self) fail. Holding loosely and Ego # Becoming highly personally invested in a task often surfaces a lot of paralyzing emotions like fear of failure. Even for work that could be life-changing, I find \u0026ldquo;holding loosely\u0026rdquo; or not caring too much about the outcome is a highly effective strategy. This frees your mind up to perform in the moment, which will often be what determines the ultimate result of the work.\nThis mindset avoids the problem of focusing on things not in your control (explored in this gamedev post about SNKRX). By definition, this thinking can\u0026rsquo;t directly lead to positive action that would improve your situation. The best it can do is maybe make you stumble upon some new information if you are doing research about the thing not in your control, but much more often I find that it leads to dead-end thoughts that make you lose motivation entirely.\nI found this concept to be extremely helpful when interviewing for jobs. Here this is particularly relevant because interviewing involves being social with your interviewer, and having a positive social interaction usually requires sharing positive emotions. It\u0026rsquo;s much easier to do this if you are actually feeling these emotions, and not faking them while internally feeling fear or panic.\nThis concept is really helpful in sports too, or anything that requires high in-the-moment performance. In fact, I was first introduced to this concept when playing tennis. I was taught to hold my racket like a tube of toothpaste - if I squeezed too hard (get too tense), the toothpaste would come out. This relaxed physical state is tightly coupled to a relaxed mental state of being \u0026ldquo;in the moment\u0026rdquo;.\nOne great exploration of this is the concept of \u0026ldquo;effortless effort\u0026rdquo; in Zen philosophy. I was first introduced to this by the book Zen in the Martial Arts by Joe Hyams. There are also some good thoughts about this in Zen Mind, Beginners Mind by Shunryu Suzuki.\nSee my thoughts on creativity for more exploration of related ideas.\nExpectations # For me, the hardest part of executing on goals is getting my entire brain on board to apply effort towards my current goal. The best way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to do this so far is by keeping the quality of the final product out of my head. In other words, I try to not have expectations for a specific result or, if that\u0026rsquo;s too hard, I at least try to keep my expectations low.\nNot worrying about my goal\u0026rsquo;s final product makes it much easier to just start doing something. My ego is protected from failure, and I can utilize all the parts of my brain that live in the moment. Usually, the best final products are honed as they are made anyway - attempting to plan out the perfect product from the start without getting feedback from the work often just leads me to a state of analysis paralysis.\nThe expectations of others are often even more extreme of a factor than my own expectations. For example, if I am given a task (or collaboratively come up with a task) that is perceived as very difficult or impossible, any progress at all will make me extremely motivated to continue. Conversely, if a task is seen as trivial to accomplish, I may not be motivated to start right away or, worse, I will feel very stressed if it ends up taking longer than expected.\nManaging Excitement # TODO maybe find a better place for this.\nOne common pattern I fall into is getting really into one particular activity for a while, exploring it thoroughly, then getting tired of it and loosing motivation to explore further. In this situation, what can help is breaking the exploration off to keep the excitement going in the next session (having a sense of anticipation for the next session).\nExecution # Some great resources for goal execution:\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits See Also # Context about why you are working on a project can help frame things: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p71j9x/comment/h9h8d3f/ https://guzey.com/productivity/ http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity Meditation to help when getting overwhelmed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7kh8pNRWOo Work specific motivation: https://jasont.co/ennui/ https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JBR6AF9Gusv4u6Fwo/laziness-death-spirals "},{"id":200,"href":"/docs/mind/myers-briggs-personality-typing/","title":"Myers Briggs Personality Typing","section":"Docs","content":" Myers-Briggs Type Indication (MBTI) # Extroverted - Introverted # Intuitive - Observant # One perspective: If your brain is trying to build a wall of information, a more Observant mind will use bricks it finds with its senses in the world around it (either via memories or present sensations).

We are all equally responsible for its success.\nKarl Popper and/or Immanuel Kant Real progress requires the act of creation, which in turn requires the belief that positive changes are possible, which IMO is a definition of optimism.\nIt is easy to sit back and point out all the flaws in the world - the creations of others. Sometimes this can be useful because it inspires new creation, but many many people do not have this goal in mind when they do this. Pure \u0026ldquo;destructive\u0026rdquo; pessimism rather causes all sorts of problems:\nIt fosters a helpless victimhood mindset, which almost by definition can\u0026rsquo;t lead to productive action. It can lead to \u0026ldquo;burn it down\u0026rdquo; actions that leave a worse world in their wake. Various political revolutions come to mind.

It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act,and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.\n"},{"id":202,"href":"/docs/mind/perspective/","title":"Perspective","section":"Docs","content":" Perspective # One way to think about perspective is as the narrative you tell yourself about the world. I think that perspective really strongly shapes more than anything else your experience and even your abilities, because the way you think about the world and the way you conceptualize it informs your behavior directly. The information we get from our senses is full of holes and is just generally imperfect. Our mind has to construct a coherent perspective out of that to act upon, so given the same inputs there are many many very valid perspectives to take from them.\nYour Mind Makes It Real # Your perspective directly shapes your behavior and is your worldview. This means it also shapes your reactions - even involuntary reactions - or even emotions or like things like pain. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t actually have real nerve pain if your perspective of the world makes you think that you should be feeling it you probably will (see rubber hand experiments). This is kind of like in The Matrix when if people die in The Matrix they die in real life because their perspective is so holy fused with their Matrix selves. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that\u0026rsquo;s how it would work in real life but I think that\u0026rsquo;s closer than you might otherwise think to the real world.\nLearning # Learning about something - understanding some concept - is really just incorporating the perspective of it into your mental model. So for instance if you want to learn history or math or something like that all it takes is for you to shape your mind so that you see the problem or the historical event or whatever you see it directly from your perspective.\nI think with things like math this is incredibly insightful. For me often math or logic problems are very hard to understand at first. Even memorization of the answer often doesn\u0026rsquo;t help with understanding and later reproduction. However at some point the problems just click into place and it becomes second nature to deploy that new logical rule or whatever in problem solving. I think that\u0026rsquo;s because at that point you see the problem from your perspective or it becomes a perspective that you have. Treating these problems in that way can help reduce the stress associated with trying to learn them and maybe help hasten the learning process.\nSelf Deception # Because there are many valid perspectives given the same set of sensory inputs if you choose to even ignore some of those inputs or twist things it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to put yourself in a state where your model of the world is very different from that of most others. Some might say this means you are deluded or even being self deceptive if you consciously choose to ignore new inputs. I think being in this state of mind is very dangerous when making real decisions that impact people\u0026rsquo;s lives. Moreover, this state of mind can be very easy to fall into. However, if your goal is to explore new ideas or discover new things, adopting this mindset may be necessary to some extent in order to put yourself in a place that allows you to do that. So I do think there\u0026rsquo;s a perilous pro and con trade-off situation to be in this self deceiving state. I do think self deception can be very positively helpful when it comes to motivation. In Peter Thiel\u0026rsquo;s talk about luck (You Are Not a Lottery Ticket) he mentions that even if luck exists it may be valuable to ignore that fact, self-deceiving yourself, because if you do then the ways in which you act will produce better outcomes than if you just assume some things are not in your control.\nSelf deception is really tricky when it comes to being a scientist or doing some kind of scientific pursuit, because on the one hand putting yourself in a new perspective that is flawed or incorrect enables you to do the experiments and try to reason through whether the perspective is actually true or not. However by putting yourself there it can be dangerous because if you are too deep in your perspective then you can start to bias your experiments and otherwise just come up with erroneous results. I do think it\u0026rsquo;s important though that some people do put themselves in those dangerous position when it comes to innovation and I don\u0026rsquo;t think they should be like a vilified or thrown out as non-scientific or something like that. I think their perspectives are important it\u0026rsquo;s just important to realize that they are in a new place which is probably mostly incorrect without just writing them off completely because I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of value that can be gained from people in this periphery.\nInspirations # I wrote down these ideas after listening to Peter Attia\u0026rsquo;s discussion on Esther Perel about like an hour or so into the podcast (1:20).\n"},{"id":203,"href":"/docs/mind/pressure-and-integrity/","title":"Pressure and Integrity","section":"Docs","content":" Pressure and Integrity # When people end up stressed or under pressure, they will more often \u0026ldquo;cheat\u0026rdquo; or otherwise violate their integrity.

Specifically, Tim argues that all perspectives should be open to higher-minded discussion and shutting down discussion on certain topics is dangerously illiberal.\nTim admits that using our higher minds requires effort, and it is impractical to completely ignore the primitive mind. I strongly agree. In fact, I think that use of the higher mind to discover some truths is extremely labor intensive, and the resulting truths are hard won artifacts. To me this means that we should really do a better job of recording and cataloging these artifacts so that when discussion comes up about them, we can point directly to them as a way to end the conversation (as opposed to doing the higher minded dance all over again).\nIn my opinion, encouraging open mindedness on every subject invites people to entertain ideas that have been proven wrong for way too long. In some ways, people use \u0026ldquo;open mindedness\u0026rdquo; as an excuse to promote bad ideas. It would be better to focus on organizing and preserving the arguments for/against ideas, and make it more of a cultural norm to shut down promotion of bad ideas unless the promoter has something novel to add to the conversation. Of course, the burden of digging through all the prior art to figure out if their contribution is novel is on the promoter to do.\nShifting our discussion in this way puts more realistic expectations on people. Accurately and correctly constructing an argument for an idea is hard and error prone, which IMO is why many people just give up and use their primitive minds to make decisions.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think freedom of speech should be suppressed by any means here.

This can necessitate further model-sharing to resolve, which can balloon a small issue into a massive ordeal. I like this quote from Valarie Kaur:\n\u0026ldquo;Deep listening is an act of surrender. We risk being changed by what we hear.\u0026rdquo;\nTo expect people to readily do this is in my opinion expecting too much. Of course, putting effort into this process is necessary for many types of work; lots of problems arise when someone is not willing to ever do this.\nThis article does a good job of providing a methodology for resolving friction around model-sharing:\nhttps://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-resolve-a-conflict-when-both-sides-are-right-1f375bc82f7f\nEmotional Consensus and Disagreement # People are very sensitive to emotions of others (accurately understood or not) in conversations. This is especially true of negative emotions. Because of this, it can very easily become the goal of a conversation to help resolve negative emotions present in your conversation partner. This can be good, but can also be a problem if your are mis-reading your partner\u0026rsquo;s emotions or if they don\u0026rsquo;t want those emotions resolved. I think it\u0026rsquo;s good to be aware of this tendency and catch yourself if you see issues arising because of it.\nRelated, one thing I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that sparks involved discussions (or heated arguments) is lack of emotional consensus on a topic. I\u0026rsquo;ve had several talks where it seems like I agree with my conversation partner, but there is still an unresolved tension in the air. This tension existed because, although we clarified facts, we still had different emotional reactions to the topic, implying that we hadn\u0026rsquo;t created a fully shared perspective. Identifying that this is the root cause of the tension can be a good way to get to the bottom of the disagreement.\nPitfalls in Productive Conversations # If we say a \u0026ldquo;productive conversation\u0026rdquo; is one where people are trying to find consensus on a particular question, there are a couple patterns that can make these conversations take much more time and energy to achieving their goal:\nHaving unclear definitions # It can sometimes be easy for a lot of conversation to happen before the participants realize that the definitions they are assuming are not the same for the relevant terms/concepts. It\u0026rsquo;s usually worth the time to get core definitions really nailed down before moving past them into what effects they have on other concepts.\nExploding the Scope # Often conversations lead to tangents that might be even more interesting to some participants than the original conversation. Being explicit about when one is making a jump to discussing a tangent can be really helpful for several reasons:\nThe other participants may not care about the tangent. The other participants may feel like the tangent-follower is assuming that they believe something about the tangent based on the previous conversation, when that\u0026rsquo;s actually not true. A common reason for following a tangent is when trying to argue for a particular viewpoint, and not finding a good path forward with the current argument. For instance, take an example where one is arguing why book X is better than a similar book Y. They might start by describing why they think the main character is more relatable, but then shift into talking about the world being more fleshed out when they run out of points. This can be jarring if the other participants are still thinking about character-relatableness, and feel like the tangent-follower is just glossing over their own points. Worst case, the tangent follower can to this intentionally to confuse their \u0026ldquo;opponents\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;win\u0026rdquo; a debate.\nReactance # People inherently like to be in control of what happens to them in their lives. When this control is threatened, resistance to the threat is the natural response. I definitely have felt this when in a situation where someone tells me to do something - even something I know I want to do. The very fact that I was told to do it makes me less interested in doing it! Sometimes this effect can be extreme.\nThis is one of the reasons why micromanagement of others leads to all sorts of problems. It is much more motivating to let people come to their own decisions about whether to do something if possible.\nIn my experience, learning is also easier when the topic of study is not dictated to me, but instead I explore it \u0026ldquo;freely\u0026rdquo;. Even reading a linear textbook can feel free (and I absorb the information better) when I set the pace and am able to jump around at will.\nCircumventing Reactance # Sometimes you still need to tell people what to do to effectively get things done. For cases where reactance is strong, creating an environment in which a person can explore and independently come to your conclusion for what needs to be done may be an effective strategy. This has the added benefit (?) of allowing them to come to an even better conclusion than your own!\nAssuming Good Intentions # It\u0026rsquo;s pretty hard sometimes to figure out why someone is doing something in particular. This clip from Malcolm in the Middle about changing a light bulb is a pretty funny extreme example, but I find this kind of situation comes up in smaller ways fairly often. If you must have expectations for someone doing something for you (which are best avoided entirely), it\u0026rsquo;s good to keep in mind that their approach is probably going to be different from yours in ways that are hard to predict. Trying to figure it out - or worse, micromanage them - may often be wasted effort and lead to interpersonal frustration.\nComplaining # People complain for at least two main reasons:\nThey need help with something. Either via: Direct help (offloading their problem in part to someone else). Advice help (having another person help improve their understanding of their problem, so that they can solve it alone without transferring any responsibility). In \u0026ldquo;How to Change your Mind\u0026rdquo; by Michael Pollan this was described as a \u0026ldquo;doing\u0026rdquo; behavior. They want to share their feelings so that others around them are on the same page about their emotional state. This is helpful e.g. so others around them will not burden them further, unaware of their current burden. This is also helpful for emotional validation reasons - it is useful to know if the thing you are upset about upsets others; if not, perhaps you are missing an easy resolution to your problem. In \u0026ldquo;How to Change your Mind\u0026rdquo; by Michael Pollan this was described as a \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; (in the moment) behavior. It is easy (at least for me) to jump strait to advice help when people complain around me and ignore the fact that the complainer may need one of the other types of resolution described above.\n"},{"id":208,"href":"/docs/morality/altruism/","title":"Altruism","section":"Docs","content":" Altruism # Good examination of effective altruism: https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/ "},{"id":209,"href":"/docs/morality/cancelling-high-contributors/","title":"Cancelling High Contributors","section":"Docs","content":" Cancelling Highly Productive People # Unfortunately, it seems like some highly productive people that have permanently improved the lives of millions of people are also either not very socially aware and/or are downright abusive to their colleagues.

Could very well have large holes in it, but currently has a large influence on how I make decisions.\nAssumption 1: Our goal is to maximize positive emotions. # Our goal is to maximize the amount of time people feel positive emotions:\nhappiness fulfillment satisfaction empowerment energy And minimize the time spent feeling negative emotions:\npain depression apathy Since this is our goal, I\u0026rsquo;ll define a \u0026ldquo;moral\u0026rdquo; act as an act that helps further this goal.\nAssumption 2: Emotions are personal reactions to experiences. # Emotions arise when an experience is having positive or negative effects on you or people/things you care about (as far as you perceive it).\nEmotions are not intrinsically tied to specific experiences. For instance, depending on the person and their context, the experience of swimming can induce a wide variety of emotions:\nfear exhaustion empowerment adventure relaxation These same emotions can be induced by a wide variety of other experiences. No experience has a \u0026ldquo;monopoly\u0026rdquo; on specific emotions, except for very low level drives (like eating satisfying hunger, drinking satisfying thirst, etc).\nAssumption 3: Experience-having requires resource destruction (cost), which often has negative emotional cost. # Most experiences require some destruction of resources to have. All experiences require the experiencer\u0026rsquo;s time at the very least, but many also require:\nThe work of other people. A share of a finite resource. In our society, we use money as a proxy for these resources, and spend that money on experiences, quantifying this exchange. Money that goes unspent can be used to have more personal experiences in the future, given to others so they can do the same, or used to build a system that makes future experience-having cheaper.\nAssumption 4: There is a lower cost threshold required for good experiences. # Everyone needs to eat, drink, and fulfill other basic needs to not suffer large amounts of negative emotions (and die). These experiences have a cost, although it can be very low. One outlier is medical care, but the minimum necessary cost of this is controversial.\nAssumption 5: Emotional effects of an experience are uncoupled to cost past their lower threshold. # Past the lower threshold for basic need type experiences, my observation is that the emotional effects of experiences are not well correlated to their cost. Rather, they are primarily influenced by the context of that experience in life. Some anecdotes:\nMedia # The excitement or other emotional reaction to media (books/movies/games) comes often from:\nNostalgia What media one has consumed in the past What one\u0026rsquo;s been thinking about recently What friends are talking about (not necessarily what\u0026rsquo;s new) Media quality. Luckily the globalization of entertainment means this does not have a large impact on individual user cost. Physicality # Most physical pleasures are almost entirely dependent on context:\nHunger can make almost any food taste good; fullness can make even the fanciest desert sickening. Sleep can be the most important thing in the world, or impossible to do. Sexual experiences can be amazing, or traumatic. Novelty # Trips to foreign lands or completely new experiences get their excitement from novelty.\nSide Note: Lifestyle Inflation # Many experiences get boring over time (they become less emotionally powerful). A common tendency is to try to make them more interesting by dumping more resources into them in an effort to \u0026ldquo;upgrade\u0026rdquo; them. This is convenient because it allows one to feel the comfort of familiarly with the experience while getting the thrill of novelty at the same time.\nUnfortunately, this can get very expensive and, even worse, can leave one at a new baseline of cost to uphold the new normal of these experiences. At this point, trying to downgrade will usually cause negative emotional reaction, which is counter to our goal.\nConclusion: Living efficiently is morally optimal. # I define efficiency as the ratio of maximum positive emotionality achieved to the cost required to achieve that emotionality. I argue that the best way to meet our original goal is to maximize the efficiency of our lives. This will allow the greatest number of people to meet their lower threshold experience costs, and leave resources left over to make it even easier to meet this cost going forward.\nWasteful activities, which are high cost but produce the same emotional return as lower cost activities, are therefore to be avoided as much as possible. Their cost indirectly takes resources away from places where those resources would be much more emotionally powerful. This can be extreme; people spend many times a basic income requirement on experiences commonly :(.\nPractical Consequences # Assumption 6: People have some control over their interests # Exposure to different people/environments can lead to adoption of a variety of different interests. Old interests can fade if experienced in new light.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t believe that a particular person\u0026rsquo;s passions are out in the world, are immutable, and just require discovery.\nThis means that people are not necessarily trapped in inefficient (and therefore immoral) interests.\nWhat would I choose? # One practical way to engage with this line of thinking is to try the following creative thinking exercise. Pretend you are creating a person (say yourself) and need to determine what that person will be interested in or passionate about. What would you choose for them? Why? What\u0026rsquo;s stopping you from adopting those interests?\nFootnotes # I recently listed to part of Peter Attia\u0026rsquo;s podcast with the author of \u0026ldquo;Die with Zero\u0026rdquo;. The fact that the ideas discussed here don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be discussed in that book led to me have a strong negative emotional reaction to the podcast.

Using this program with Pandora or other free music services was an effective way to build up a little library.\nI then started checking out CDs en-masse from the local library, and ripping them to add to my collection. I was very particular about getting them in a lossless flac format, which lead to my library total size on disk growing very large.\nI had a friend who was really into dubstep and UK electronic music at the time, and merged his library into mine.\nI then started getting into some smaller indie artists who didn\u0026rsquo;t have CDs at the library, so I switched to getting a lot of music off of bandcamp (mainly with this script).\nMost recently, I discovered SoulSeek, which has a great Android app. I use this to get music I can\u0026rsquo;t find anywhere else.\nUsage History # I used to use a Zune to listen to my collection. It had a spinning disk inside it that could store all my large music.

Then let me fit everything into a 200 GB Google Drive plan. I used CloudPlayer on Android to listen to this, which was a great system.\nSoon enough, I started running out of space on my Google Drive, and the next plan to upgrade to was 2TB, which was way overkill for me. This led me to start storing all my music on local drives again, which had the added benefit of not requiring and internet connection or cached files to listen.\nCurrent Setup # Right now I store two clones of my music library, one on my desktop computer, and one on an SD card inside my Android phone. The two libraries and kept in sync with one other via syncthing, which works incredibly well. Way way better than a program called SyncToy I used to use for this purpose a long long time ago.\nWhenever I get new music from any source, I dump it directly into Google Drive. The gdrive CLI is really good for this. Then I use a program called DriveSync on Android to sync any new stuff from my drive to my library on the SD card. Then syncthing moves it to my desktop.

As I understood it he describes Marxism as not really an active proposal for how to structure society, but rather as just a critique of capitalism and a specific description of what about capitalism is wrong without any necessarily specific instructions about what to do instead. For instance he talks about how Marx almost never talked about government. It didn\u0026rsquo;t sound like he had many opinions about whether government should be big or small or whatever.\nCo-ops # This lack of actionability led me to be really grasping during the podcast to try to figure out what could be tried that would be better than capitalism. One thing that caught my attention was Richard Wolff\u0026rsquo;s description of co-ops as something that Marx would probably approve of.\nA co-op is just a business where all the revenue that comes in is distributed by the employees. The people who are employees of the co-op or maybe even co-owners decide what to do with that profit and it\u0026rsquo;s not up to one single individual like an owner to distribute the money as they see fit. It seems like by this definition a co-op like structure could help reduce the inequality that we see in the world because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a collection of employees would vote to pay one person like say the owner a lot more than everybody else.\nSo I started thinking about what this means - how would you actually achieve a co-op like structure where I\u0026rsquo;ll just say everybody is a co-owner. There\u0026rsquo;s probably other ways to do it but that makes the most sense or is the simplest to me. So everybody owns an equal share of the business and they have equal voting rights.\nI struggle to understand how this could happen. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say I start a software business, write some software, and then sell it directly to people who pay me for the program and support. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that I run the business by myself and one day want to hire somebody else to help me with the business. It seems like what I would have to do is upon hiring of that person I would have to give them a gift of half the company. Or maybe as they work they would grow their half of the company because if I just gave him half the company then in theory they could just sell it and leave and never actually work for me and just take the money. So maybe they would have to over time work up to it like a vesting schedule.\nEven then it\u0026rsquo;s it seems kind of strange that the person that you hire has so much leverage immediately on the company. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s not that strange but it feels strange to me especially if you\u0026rsquo;re hiring somebody to do a specific task. For instance if you needed to pay somebody to just make the graphics for your website and that\u0026rsquo;s it. For someone hired to do some very specific task that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily involve strategic direction over the company it seems weird that they would be given a big part of something that you built. This would mean people would just have to be very careful about how they hire, which would probably slow a company\u0026rsquo;s ability to hire because you\u0026rsquo;re not really hiring somebody you\u0026rsquo;re more like partnering with somebody. Every single person who joins your organization effectively becomes a partner.\nThis would make decision making a lot harder because pretty much everything would have to be voted on. Perhaps there would be representatives like like an internal senate or something where representatives would make the decisions for the company\u0026rsquo;s direction and not every single employee would have to be involved.\nThe part of this like that\u0026rsquo;s the most unclear to me is like how you could set up a structure where when you\u0026rsquo;re hiring your first, your second, or third, fourth, fifth employee how their ownership would manifest. What would happen if they leave? Are they forced to sell their shares in the company when they leave or does it just disappear and everybody else gets a bigger slice of the company? Or their voting rights are lost but they still hold their shares?\nMaybe thinking about the company in terms of shares is part of my confusion. Maybe it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be thought of that way, although in the end if a majority of the employees decide to sell the company that should be possible. Then there would be a way for employees to cash out. Perhaps limiting the liquidity of the stock is the way to manage these issues.\nThis train of thought makes me interested in learning more how current co-ops like Costco or WinCo or PCC grew. How did they start? How do they grow? Does every employee have an equal voting right who owns them?\n"},{"id":220,"href":"/docs/society/communal-living/","title":"Communal Living","section":"Docs","content":" Communal Living # In media like Everyday Utopia, communal living situations are brought up as a way to help people get a better sense of community and lead happier lives.

If true, it’s kind of crazy to think that a large fraction of the financial inequality in at least the United States or wherever the study was done is due to financial literacy.\nThis got me thinking more generally about the price of freedom to make our own choices and to play the game of life. I feel like in a very individualistic society like the United States people have a lot of freedom with their choices and there\u0026rsquo;s relatively little guidance or forced defaulting that helps guide people to make the right decisions. For instance, I can do whatever I want with my own money: I can invest it in whatever I want, or just put it all in the bank without investing it anywhere. I can buy the most random stuff with it and there\u0026rsquo;s no real fall back if I make poor decisions - I just have to suffer the consequences. This is true with a lot of other things too like physical health, media consumption habits, mental health, etc. A lot of these areas are very unintuitive and difficult to perform well in so it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to “lose” the game of life in certain dimensions without the defaulting or other guardrails that are less \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; society would provide to its citizens. I think this freedom to make decisions and stuff has a lot of benefits but without any defaults I feel like you can lead a lot of people to make really poor decisions just because they don\u0026rsquo;t know any better and that can perpetuate a lot of problems like social inequality.\nThis line of thinking has made me think that \u0026ldquo;information inequality\u0026rdquo; via lack of exposure to people who talk about finances or talk about health or whatever might be a bigger problem than I thought. If someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t expose themselves to said people or their culture doesn\u0026rsquo;t really value this kind of knowledge, or has suboptimal opinions on how to approach these topics, they are going to have a harder time succeeding in life. They will be making worse decisions due to their information environment.\nI think having the government provide some basic default services that people have to opt out of might help combat this inequality. The price of these services would be deducted from paychecks, but if people wanted to solve these problems themselves they could just opt out and get their money directly.

This is easier if the constituents are more similar in their views, as then the representative needs to do less work to consider all the different perspectives they should be representing.

It does seem like this kind of system might at least be more \u0026ldquo;honest\u0026rdquo; or at least straightforward - it seems like geographical lines are often used as a proxy for these characteristics anyway.\nIssue-Based Representation # One interesting point is that different groups may be more or less relevant for different issues. For instance, geography is very relevant when deciding where to add new bus lines. And profession is very relevant when deciding how to tax different industries.\nIf our goal is to make the job of representatives easier by giving them a homogeneous group of constituents, this is an issue.\nThere are at least two ways to handle this:\nHave different representative groups for different issues. This gets complicated - do we have multiple presidents?? Try to pick groups that lead to the most relevance across the most issues. At least we can do better than geography, right? Abandoning Representativeness # We could instead just get rid of the concept of representation of specific groups of people and just give parties representatives according to a single popular vote for the party. Party identity is in a sense the best way to group people by their political views. For instance, if there were 100 seats and 45% of people nationwide voted for democrats, then democrats would get 45 seats regardless of the locations of their voters. It looks like Germany does this in part by giving parties extra seats in their legislature based on their total national vote share after all constituencies have been given seats: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Germany#Bundestag.\n"},{"id":224,"href":"/docs/society/individuals-vs-groups/","title":"Individuals vs Groups","section":"Docs","content":" Individuals Vs Groups # Political problems are complicated and multifaceted almost by definition.

In America, losing your job means losing your health insurance and potentially having a hard time finding another job.\nThis dynamic leads to persistence of inefficient and often harmful status quos. For instance, there are many jobs that are \u0026ldquo;bullshit\u0026rdquo; in that they don\u0026rsquo;t contribute meaningfully to society, or even detract from it. People with these jobs are often aware of this, but they don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose their job, so they continue to do it and even defend its existence!\nPoliticians often pander to large electorates of people with jobs on the sole platform of maintaining them or making more, nevermind the usefulness of the jobs in question.

This is tempting because it promises that the clean model in your head for how things should work could be reality, and you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with the current system with its quirks and bad models any longer. This is dangerous because within all those quirks exist real decisions made by prior developers that handle real use cases. Many of these decisions will inevitably be lost in the re-write, and will need to be re-discovered and patched over time, which is duplicate work.\nIn the podcast David mentions that he is a fan of evolutionary societal change, where existing institutions are respected and changed slowly, instead of being torn down in a revolution. I think this is kinda similar to the idea of incrementally changing code, as opposed to rewriting it from scratch. Institutions (I assume) also have many quirks and patched edge cases that carry real, hard won value.

For example:\nClimate Change could be solved if we all transitioned to using more renewable sources of energy. The Obesity Epidemic could be solved if we all ate less food. Individual Change and Shaming # One common proposal I\u0026rsquo;ve heard for solving at least the above problems is using a \u0026ldquo;grassroots\u0026rdquo; approach. This method would involve first changing your own behavior such that the problem would be solved if everyone behaved like you, then trying to influence others to adopt your new behavior(s). This seems simple enough, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s the best way forward, and in some ways is actively harmful.\nThe tacit assumption with this proposal is that people are able to choose what behaviors to adopt. I would argue that in fact our behaviors are much more influenced by our environment than we would like to admit. One component of our environment is indeed other people peer pressuring us, but (IMO) far more dominant factors include:\nEconomics (how much the behavior change costs) \u0026ldquo;At hand\u0026rdquo;-ness (what other behaviors are \u0026ldquo;at hand\u0026rdquo; and easy to do) When these factors are overpowering (which I argue they usually are), peer pressure becomes a form of bullying and social rejection that the target of which is powerless to stop. Perpetuating this is downright cruel.\nChanging the Environment # If a grassroots behavior change movement isn\u0026rsquo;t the best way to solve the problem, then what can we do instead? In my opinion, the answer is environmental change. This can take several forms:\n1. Local Environmental Change # This involves making changes to an individual\u0026rsquo;s local environment (the spaces they interact with on a habitual basis) to guide them to certain behaviors. Some examples would be intentionally not buying unhealthy food when at the grocery store so that when at home these foods are not \u0026ldquo;at hand\u0026rdquo;. Or not buying a car so that you instead need to bike or bus to get around.\nNote that the line here can be pretty blurry between what is an actual behavior change and what is simply an action that changes one\u0026rsquo;s environment. Because of this, I think the stronger, ultimate solution is:\n2. Policy-Level Environmental Change # Government policies can create massive environmental changes. For example, extra taxes on certain products can massively impact people\u0026rsquo;s buying decisions. Or bans of certain products can completely change the suite of chemicals that individuals are exposed to on a daily basis.\nA natural objection is to point out that in a democracy, the majority of people (in theory) choose what policies are enacted. Because of this, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t people just vote for policies that help them perpetuate their current behavior set - which they presumably \u0026ldquo;chose\u0026rdquo; and/or otherwise would like to keep?\nI argue that actually people are quite able to vote in a way counter to their everyday actions. For instance, people who enjoy soda may vote for a sugar-sweetened beverage tax. The reason why (I think) this is because the mental state you adopt when voting is generally different that the mental state when deciding - or not consciously deciding at all - to engage in a particular behavior.\nThis is especially true when voting on higher level, more abstract policies. For instance, banning a certain type of energy production might indirectly increase someone\u0026rsquo;s cost of living by quite a bit in various ways, but thinking about the policy in a more abstract sense may lead someone to approve it despite this personal impact.\nBased on my own emotions, I also think that people by and large care deeply about how their lives compare to those of others around them. A tax that greatly increases everyone\u0026rsquo;s cost of living is much more bearable than one that targets just an individual person. It\u0026rsquo;s much rarer for people to worry about their absolute standing than how they compare to others - the fact that the majority of people today live like the elites of a couple centuries ago is not a great source of comfort and satisfaction generally speaking.\nThis, like many solutions to big problems, does depend on an educated populace that is able to reason about the effects of certain policies. Ensuring this condition is itself a large scale societal problem that hopefully can be solved with this same line of thinking. I do admit there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here :/.\nNudging # The book Nudge explores one philosophy with which good policies can be crafted without impinging too much on individual liberty.\nExternality-based Policies # Many societal problems are due to hard-to-track externalities of existing behaviors that are not \u0026ldquo;priced in\u0026rdquo; to the cost of the behavior. For instance, companies that make unhealthy food do not pay for the healthcare costs their products incur. Or single-use plastic producers do not pay for waste cleanup efforts. Or petroleum refiners do not pay for CO2 emissions. If these externalities were priced in, then the consumer would have a much easier time making buying decisions, as the real cost of their consumption would be obvious to them.\nCurrently, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to know the real cost of a given behavior, which is further confused by emotional arguments on either side. For example, if you want to know if you should use plastic straws or not, the low price of them might make you think they are an efficient way to solve your problem. But others would argue that [some large number] of straws are used every second! Unfortunately, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really tell you very much. If instead it cost a dollar to clean up every discarded straw, and that was priced into the straws cost since the producing company had to clean up the straws, then you as the consumer could make a more informed decision about whether that dollar is worth it.\nOf course, tracking all these externalities is hard. But this seems like a useful framework, or at least more useful that trying to get consumers to all individually understand the externalities of their actions.\nProbably someone else somewhere has done a much better job exploring this topic.\n3. Technological Environmental Change # New technologies dramatically change the environment people live in. Interestingly, they usually do this without requiring the bureaucracy required to enact government policies. Therefore, the development of new technologies to solve societal problems, like geoengineering techniques for climate change, has a lot of potential. And some problems can only be solved with new technologies (like preventing aging).\n4. Cultural Environmental Change # Shifting cultural norms also can lead to massive change in individual behavior. I don\u0026rsquo;t really know the best way this can be leveraged without the \u0026ldquo;grassroots\u0026rdquo; problem I mentioned above, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.\nPersonal Impact # Given this theory, if someone feels strongly that certain problems need to be solves, what should they do?\nInfluencing government policy is a lot of work and is, I would argue, a task that requires specialized skills. This means that someone who invests more time in building these skills will hone them, and have more leverage when applying them. Therefore, an effective path to personally solving societal problems is to invest a lot of time and energy in honing and applying these skills. Note that I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about lobbying here, but rather actually writing laws and doing the research that motivates their creation and design. This kind of environment building can also be done outside of formal government in private organizations that fill some roles that a government might otherwise fill.\nOur hypothetical person could also get deep into creating a technology that solves the problem they care about. This arguably takes even more time/energy investment to see significant returns.\nFor those who do not want to, or cannot, invest time/energy in influencing policy or developing new technologies, one fallback option is to instead hone another set of skills, apply them to make money, and then fund policymakers/inventors with the proceeds. This will probably have a bigger impact than dabbling in invention/policymaking, and certainly will have a bigger impact than just changing your own behavior.\nRegardless, being a creative optimist (as opposed to a destructive pessimist) is important.\nHypocrisy # If you assume that \u0026ldquo;grassroots\u0026rdquo; individual change has little to no impact on societal problems, then a lot of seemly hypocritical behavior is explained and even excused. For instance, it is very reasonable to believe strongly that society would be better if everyone was vegan, while eating the readily available non-vegan foods provided by society. It even makes some sense that someone super passionate about some political issue - to the point where they organize protests or voting campaigns - may not vote for the issue themselves! In my opinion, these behaviors are more a demonstration of how these hypothetical people think they can manifest change as opposed to what they truly believe.\nTesting this Theory # Right now this line of thinking is just a plausible (at least to me) idea. I would love to see some evidence for this, but don\u0026rsquo;t have any at hand right now to cite. So (as always) I might be totally wrong :).\n"},{"id":230,"href":"/docs/society/utopia/","title":"Utopia","section":"Docs","content":" Achieving Utopia # Problems # Humanity has some big problems that need to be solved before we can safely say we have built a utopia.\nWasted Human Potential # Most people spend their productive time doing work that does not materially move our society forward. As discussed later, people have the potential to create completely new ideas that radically and positively improve the lives of humanity as a whole. Any work that does not leverage this potential by definition wastes it, slowing our progress toward a utopia.\nIf our economy could somehow adequately value this potential, a lot of these problems might solve themselves (as the cost of labor would be prohibitive).\nMaintenance Work # This kind of work is currently necessary work that keeps society from backsliding. It is extremely important, but we should be working to automate it or find ways to avoid needing it to make progress.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WAe0f74Q0s\nService Work # In my opinion, most service work is already unnecessary given the alternatives. It makes me sad to see so many people working as waiters/waitresses, cashiers, in call centers, etc. when there are (often better) systems that provide the same service without requiring people.\nNot Seeing the Potential # Rejecting the idea that all humans have creative potential is commonplace, and greatly harms the many people that are discriminated against when selection for creative roles occurs. TODO flesh this out.\nDeath # The death of an individual is extremely tragic for at least these reasons:\nAll the knowledge and perspective the individual accumulated over their lifetime is lost permanently. Records can only partially remedy this. The social web the person was a part of is violently damaged. The people close to the dying person suffer greatly and are less able to create for a time (sometimes permanently). To protect ourselves emotionally, we have built traditions and societal norms around accepting death and treating it an inevitable. Given our progress towards understanding aging (the cause of the vast majority of deaths), this is starting to become a problem.\nWar # The terrible combination of the above two problems. Should be avoided at all costs.\nMeritocratic Thinking # Our society is structured so that more successful people are seen as more \u0026ldquo;deserving\u0026rdquo; that less successful ones. This can help with motivation to be better, but leads to a lot of injustice. In my opinion the emotions of all people are equally important to maintain in a positive place - meritocracy is often directly opposed to this goal.\nSolutions # In my opinion, we should be putting all people to work solving the above problems. In doing so, we should be able to reach utopia more quickly, and in so doing alleviate much suffering.\nHumanity\u0026rsquo;s Superpower # People have the uniquely powerful ability to come up with arbitrary explanations for how stuff works and then critically compare them against each other. This creative process has led to all major advances in human history, and is responsible for the accelerating rate of progress we all enjoy today. This progress is in turn responsible for alleviating a tremendous amount of suffering, and for creating a myriad of new ways for people to feel happy, satisfied, or otherwise good. It also has enabled people to automate many time and energy consuming tasks that have historically either directly caused suffering, or gotten in the way of further progress and/or doing things that feel good.\nCreative thought as I\u0026rsquo;ve defined it is the most important tool we have to improve our state as a species (and to continue avoiding existential threats). Therefore, we should be primarily orienting our society to encourage creative thought and reduce the amount of time required to engage in non-creative work to keep things running. If we can successfully do this, then we will maximize our ability to solve all other hard problems facing our species, such as resource shortages, aging, climate change, and successfully governing ourselves. Additionally, arguably people will lead more fulfilling lives, as more of their time will be spent thinking about interesting things and sharing those thoughts as opposed to grinding away at Sisyphean maintenance tasks.\nHow can we do this?\nBasic Need Satisfaction # We need to ensure that every person on earth has their basic (food, shelter, medicine, mental health) needs met through automation. Worrying about basic needs is probably the biggest distraction away from creative thought that exists today.\nWorrying about basic needs and/or accumulation of wealth for a rainy day can also lead to perverse incentives, where someone will work on something with money as their only object. Ideally, our economic system would make the most useful work the most lucrative (and this problem wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist), but unfortunately this isn\u0026rsquo;t always the case. This leads to the all too common situation where people choose not to do the most helpful/important thing they could be because another option is more lucrative.\nA simple solution to this would be to supply everyone with a nanofabricator that can produce food, tools, and everything else required to survive. Unfortunately, currently this solution is still science fiction, and we instead must rely on large shared systems that utilize economies of scale to provide needs at a minimum cost. Distributing resources in these systems is hard, and our growing wealth inequality today is evidence that we are doing a poor job.\nSo far, some kind of universal basic income seems to me to be the best short term solution to this problem. This would provide a \u0026ldquo;floor\u0026rdquo; that people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to fall beneath. It would also allow markets to keep service production efficient, which wouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily be the case if the government simply provided the needs directly.\nTyranny of Other People # All societies have some parts in which people are at the mercy of other people who control their employment status, political status, time, and/or access to resources. This often leads to disasterous results (see the atrocities committed by totalitarian regimes, or the depression caused by an abusive boss) and in general creates a lot of daily stress for the people that have to make sure their controllers are happy with them. Basic need satisfaction would go a long way towards eliminating this problem as well.\nFreedom of Information and Education # It\u0026rsquo;s hard to think creatively when you have no prior ideas to remix together into new ones. Making information and educational resources universally accessible and engaging is crucial to spark creativity. To do this we should continue encouraging the growth of the internet, and the growth of free and open publication of scientific discovery (and thoughts in general). People who write down novel ideas should have their needs covered by the automation described above, and therefore will not need to worry about how to monetize their work (which wastes everyone\u0026rsquo;s time and energy, and cuts people out of the creative process).\nSpecifically, I think we should severely limit copyright laws and allow people to copy and access all digital content freely, including source code, movies, books, school courses, \u0026ldquo;trade secrets\u0026rdquo;, etc. Direct compensation for this work would come from UBI and possibly grants if UBI doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover all expenses.\nFreedom of Direction # In the book \u0026ldquo;Greatness Cannot be Planned: The Myth of the Objective\u0026rdquo;, the authors argue that all hard problems suffer from deceptive paths to their solutions. Therefore, attempting to grade or judge performance by comparing a current state to a specific goal is misleading. This focus on objective thinking is particularly dangerous when applied to people - using objectives to encourage someone to do X or Y stifles that persons ability to exercise their most powerful tool: their creativity. Instead, that person will just act in accordance with the given objective, even if they have novel ideas they would otherwise try to pursue.\nTo approach utopia, it makes sense to try to constrain the behavior of individuals as little as possible so that the most novel ideas can be explored. One way this could be conceptualized is by encouraging flaneur-like behavior as described in \u0026ldquo;Antifragile\u0026rdquo; by NN Taleb. This has the additional side benefit of giving people space, time, and therefore ability to support the ideas of others that they discover and think are important. Related is Taleb\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Convex Tinkering\u0026rdquo; concept, which supports the idea that randomly exploring many ideas is perhaps the most efficient path to discovery.\nOrganizations # This concept can also apply to larger organizations of many people, like local governments. If those governments have a lot of freedom to experiment with different policies, this could lead to discovery of the best policies overall. In practice, this would looks like a confederation of autonomous states, like Switzerland and to a lesser extent the United States of America.\nAt the government level, this experimentation can be dangerous, so it is crucial that people are able to leave governments that they anticipate will harm them. This means that both some kind of universal bill of rights and resources that help people move are extremely important.\nInfluences # This is heavily inspired by The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch.\nOther reading: https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\nSee also thoughts on creativity.\n"},{"id":231,"href":"/docs/society/utopian-idea-management/","title":"Utopian Idea Management","section":"Docs","content":" Utopian Idea Management # As touched on in Utopia, in my opinion the concept that people can \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; any form of information and have sole right to profit off of it is deeply problematic to me.\nIdeas and information more generally is derived from existing info, no matter how \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; it may look.

This is widely recommended, but also laborious and at times \u0026ldquo;flow-killing\u0026rdquo;. Also if your system is composed of many small functions, it can be hard to motivate yourself to write multiple tests for every single one.\nAnother solution is to use a debugger, and stop execution of your program at the function in question and use the context from the debugger to fix the problem.

At which level. Are you doing BDD on the interfaces between large subsystems? Only on your public API (what which point your space of possible inputs/ouputs is ~infinite)? If you squint right, a unit test on a function is BDD applied to the interface of that specific function. Kovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:11 PM, Edited Also to clarify, if you are doing some kind of test driven development where you have only high level public interface tests written first (maybe this is BDD?) you would still be writing nested functions without tests Andrew Stewart, Jan 19, 2022, 4:11 PM I wouldn\u0026#39;t say I do much BDD / TDD, but a lack of unit tests is a major code smell +1 to what Tim said, depends a lot on which layer you\u0026#39;re testing or not testing Kovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:12 PM the inspiration for my idea was to smooth the code writing/reading process, NOT to replace unit tests just to be clear Tim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:13 PM To Kovas\u0026#39;s initial question... I\u0026#39;ve thought about this very thing too Kovas. I think you could implement such a thing very similarly to how we do image diff testing with SCUBA. Specifically, the tooling helps A LOT in the ergonomics of accepting desired changes that might effect lots of \u0026#34;goldens\u0026#34;, showing diffs between \u0026#34;goldens\u0026#34; and variants, etc. Kovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:14 PM isn\u0026#39;t SCUBA just helping interpret test results at a very high level tho? what if it takes 20+ seconds for your scuba test to run? (i haven\u0026#39;t used SCUBA, so maybe it\u0026#39;s faster) Tanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:16 PM I suppose my assertion is that if you have code which isn\u0026#39;t tested then there is literally no definition of correct except for the behavior as written, which becomes also correct when changed in arbitrary ways. If you are debugging something you are trying to figure out why it is not correct, but you should have an assertion that it is indeed not correct before you attempt to \u0026#34;fix\u0026#34; the code Tim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:16 PM Actually my idea is different from yours. Youre talking about saving off the inputs. I was talking about saving off the outputs. Take all the tests we do which EXPECT protos to have certain fields. I\u0026#39;ve wondered... what if we just dumped all the wanted protos to text format in a file... and then saved that file as a golden, and used diff tools to see the difference? The benefit is you avoid having to have written all those test cases. Then add proto-level annotations in order to automatically ignore fields that can change (e.g. timestamps) Sorry to take it off track 😀 Tanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:18 PM Practically speaking though, I think you could look up auto-generated parameterized unit tests to match the idea you\u0026#39;ve had Tim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:20 PM yeah Andrew Stewart, Jan 19, 2022, 4:21 PM It\u0026#39;s not a mechanism for capturing inputs, but stuff like google3/testing/production_stub/public/testvalue.h does allow tests to inject values in tests that might otherwise be difficult Tanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:22 PM At my old company we would use a system of input generators which were called \u0026#34;Arbitrary[x]\u0026#34; which would generate an arbitrary instance of X. This is similar to proto generators I suppose, but slightly more nuanced in that you could define what an arbitrary instance looks like and relationships between data on it. Then when you tested the interface, you would construct said arbitrary instance of your inputs with constraints on specific things you cared about, and very ergonomically write unit tests in a BDD fashion (with associated language) See https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/generator_driven_property_checks if you are interested; I very much like that style of testing and https://www.scala-exercises.org/scalacheck/arbitrary Kovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:26 PM Here\u0026#39;s a more concrete example of how I think this would be useful: You\u0026#39;re debugging a flaky error in a program that normally takes a while to run. You could: (1) Run the program with a debugger/print statements multiple times to try to triangulate what function is causing the error so you can reproduce the issue in a unit test, then fix the function. (2) With this idea, you run the program once, then run individual functions with the saved input data until you find the problem, write your test, and fix it. In case (2) there is less waiting and more interactive development Tim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:26 PM @Tanner Young Would that be similar to adding lots of assert statements that check that certain relationships between your data hold, and then feeding in arbitrary data? Tanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:27 PM @Tim Ford in implementation no; it does not generate random data and then verify assertions on it. You instead write your own generator using more basic building blocks (like other generators). \u0026gt; You\u0026#39;re debugging a flaky error in a program that normally takes a while to run. You could: Just use the original flake error, no? Kovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM but what if you\u0026#39;re not sure which function is causing the error? Tanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM I guess it depends, I was only thinking about test execution order as a source of flake (which can be reproduced), doesn\u0026#39;t work for thread locking errors Tim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM @Kovas Palunas I guess I see what you\u0026#39;re saying... in practice, in such scenarios, I think I usually find a place where a test should be but isn\u0026#39;t. or where a test is wrong or incomplete Kovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM i agree, but finding the root cause has to be done before you can write the missing test Tanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM This is especially difficult for classes of parallel execution errors.. Kovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM yep that\u0026#39;s true Tim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:39 PM yeah... if you could replay all sources of input to the program (not individual functions), then you could attach a debugger, set whatever breakpoints you might want, and then replay. In a past game development job we did something like that. But with parallelism issues, the kernel\u0026#39;s scheduling decisions are inputs, and you have subtle timing issues too... so yeah, it could not handle that kind of thing I think that class of issue is better handled with something like TSan or Rust static or dynamic data race detection/prevention Tanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:39 PM \u0026gt; I think that class of issue is better handled with something like TSan or Rust Now we\u0026#39;re talking... Andrew Stewart, Jan 19, 2022, 4:59 PM Not explicitly related to the topic, but http://go/atomic-danger talks about some things that are difficult to test David Poliakoff, Jan 20, 2022, 7:42 AM Another use case for this was at my last job, we often couldn\u0026#39;t share entire sensitive codes or inputs externally, but could share security-reviewed snippets. So we would often write code that would wrap functions, typically at a library boundary, and record inputs. Then we would be able to relaunch functions with those given inputs. It turned out to be pretty expensive to do in practice. Personally I\u0026#39;m of an \u0026#34;if you can test it, do test it\u0026#34; mentality. There were also efforts in resilience, though, which could detect whether the same execution of a kernel/function could produce substantively different outputs, if you\u0026#39;re looking for nondeterminism.

Some very non-ergonomic languages may still be the right choice because lots of libraries have been written for that language, so the total amount of work to do to accomplish anything is dramatically reduced.

For instance, design documents often have lists of requirements, UML/component diagrams, sections on supporting systems (telemetry, testing, security, etc.), internal technical details, etc. This can make it hard to spot holistic issues with the design, as focus will mostly be on individual sections. Additionally, large designs can push reviewers to mentally paraphrase and gloss over complex sections, making holes of vagueness in the design easy to miss.\nDesign documents can also be very hard to write when there are so many unknowns at the outset of a project. Prototyping before design is a good way to manage this, but is not a perfect solution. There is always the danger of going too far with the prototype (spending too much time on work that will need to be re-done) or not going far enough (and missing important insight about how things should be done). Prototying is also not always technically feasible.\nAn alternate step to take before design (or instead of design), is to write guided documentation for the final product as if it existed. This documentation would walk though the critical user journeys of the proposed product, going into more implementation detail than a normal documentation page. One way to think about this is \u0026ldquo;prototying via documentation\u0026rdquo; (instead of in code).\nBy walking through all the steps like this, it is much more concrete what the user experience will be like, and holes or unknowns will be easier to spot.

I think visualizing this is a good way of normalizing the fact that everybody needs that kind of time.

For instance, a robot voice may not give weight to a sentence that a human would.\nIt would be neat if an author could somehow encode this vocal inflection in their text (by using bold/italics or special characters) in such a way that a text to speech encoder could react to, to generate more natural sounding audio.\nPoets (or artistic authors) could even hijack this system to instead add bizarre inflection to their text such that it would sound strange when text-to-speechified. I imagine you could do some pretty wild stuff here, from creating novel accents to spicing up rhyming verses.

If you then turn the box so that the rod or movable wall is facing the ground, you can remove the wall and let the pieces fall downward, advancing the frame and animating the gif/video.\nVariation # Make the stack of frames, then drill a hole in one corner and thread a rod through the stack.

Mentally find commonalities between those experiences and create an abstract model in your head to help predict what might happen in a similar, future experience. Test your model by having that future experience and seeing what happens. Refine or discard the model as more experiences inform it. A key trap to avoid falling in to here is exiting the loop and believing that your model is \u0026ldquo;the truth\u0026rdquo;. This assumes that all possible experiences have been explored, which is impossible.\nThe presence of this trap does not mean abstract theories are useless or not worth developing (because you will never find their solution). Abstract models are in fact very useful as tools in your toolbox when approaching a new experience. They just must be applied as hypotheses, and held lightly.\nThis kind of thinking can be hard sometimes, because it sort-of involves holding two conflicting ideas in your head (which is painful)1. These are:\nThe theory explains how something abstract works. The theory is only applicable in some concrete scenerios (and even then, may not be correct). This is a bit of a paradox because to describe an abstract theory you necessarily must state that it works in an abstract context. They key is realizing that this explanation is incomplete. So you kinda have to \u0026ldquo;believe a lie\u0026rdquo; in part to apply the theory.\nExample: Personality Typing # One very abstract theory is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) for personality typing. It attempts to condense the complexity of an individual person into a 4 letter code (4 binary dimensions) that describes their behavior. This is extremely abstract and incomplete.\nDespite the oversimplicity of MBTI, it can still be useful. For example, if two people are clashing because they are approaching a problem in two different ways (and each thinks their way is best), MBTI can give them a language with which to see the validity of the other person\u0026rsquo;s approach. Here the theory acts as a neutral third party to help settle the dispute.\nIt could also not work in this situation at all depending on the people. The danger is believing too much that the theory is correct and trying to force its application. This is where general theories become dangerous. The best approach if the theory\u0026rsquo;s application isn\u0026rsquo;t leading to practically useful results (here helping the two people see eye-to-eye) is to move on to the next theory in the toolbox that could help.\nGiving Advice # Often advice takes the form of an abstract adage or theory that the advice giver thinks will help the advice seeker. Just like with applying theories in other ways, IMO advice is best given as a hypotheses; a \u0026ldquo;this might help you\u0026rdquo; kind of statement.\nA lot of interpersonal tension and harm can come when the advice giver assumes that the theory 100% applies to the seekers situation. In this case, if the seeker doesn\u0026rsquo;t follow the theory, the giver would conclude that the seeker \u0026ldquo;just doesn\u0026rsquo;t get it\u0026rdquo; or is otherwise misinterpreting them. Then they might push the theory and start to feel unheard or ignored. The issue here is that it is really really hard to know what is going on in the seeker\u0026rsquo;s mind (only they might know, but even that is not guaranteed). For the giver to presume they do is already a massive error.\nThis can happen a lot (with bad consequences) in power-asymmetrical relationships like child-parent or teacher-student or wife-husband in some cultures. As far as I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced, it\u0026rsquo;s best as a giver to just listen to the seeker as much as possible to help them work through their problem, providing lightly-held hypotheses as they think of them.\nThis can be true even in a very technical field (e.g. engineering) where the giver might be confident that eventually the seeker will realize that truth of what they are saying. Even here, in order to properly incorporate the advice, the seeker\u0026rsquo;s mind must be prepared (e.g. have taken the prerequisite courses). Just because the advice is good in this case does not mean it\u0026rsquo;s good in general!\nSome good thinking on advice giving: https://guzey.com/advice/\nNote this this isn\u0026rsquo;t the most common way the term cognitive dissonance is used - usually it explains the pain that directs people towards ignoring new information that conflicts with their existing beliefs.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":249,"href":"/docs/understanding-the-world/copyright-and-ip/","title":"Copyright and IP","section":"Docs","content":" Copyright and IP # TODO finish this piece.\nHarnessing creativity is the key to improving society.\nBecause creativity is mostly about remixing existing ideas, then it makes sense to make sharing ideas as easy as possible.\nhttps://buttondown.email/a327ex/archive/authorship-isnt-real/\nThe question of copyright is even more important in the case of creativity meant to solve real world problems.\nhttps://sci-hub.se/\nhttps://libgen.rs/\nhttps://laniakeabooks.org/#home\nhttps://matthewstrom.com/writing/copying/\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44914109\n"},{"id":250,"href":"/docs/understanding-the-world/great-explanations/","title":"Great Explanations","section":"Docs","content":" Great Explanations # A list of great explanations for things I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled across.\nGPS: https://ciechanow.ski/gps/ Programming Tetris in ClojureScript: https://shaunlebron.github.io/t3tr0s-slides/#0 "},{"id":251,"href":"/docs/understanding-the-world/influences/","title":"Influences","section":"Docs","content":" Influences # These works have guided my thinking about how to discover truths about the world.

Both help you make your own decisions:\nReason 1: To help you determine if you should make the same decision or not. # This is fairly straightforward: if someone else has already gone through the work of making a decision, it can be easier to try to judge their decision instead of coming up with your own from scratch. If you deem their decision good, then you can simply make it. Otherwise, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a starting off point for making your own decision.\nReason 2: To help you determine if the decision maker is to be trusted with other similar decisions. # A common concrete application is hiring. Interviews are ultimately trying to determine if a candidate will be good at the job, which can be modeled as a bunch of decisions. If the candidate is bad at making the decisions they will need to in their work, then they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hired.\nHow? # I think judging decisions is really tricky. The idea I outline here is just that: an idea. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim that this is better than other methods, or that it\u0026rsquo;s even useful at all in practice.\nOne way to judge decisions is by seeing them as a tree of considerations. For example:\nShould I vote for candidate X or Y? Which candidate will be better for the economy? Which candidate will be better for my local economy? Which candidate\u0026rsquo;s morals align more with my own? Which candidate do I think is more honest? For many decisions, a massively complex tree of possibilities can be built. When these trees are explored by decision makers, most of the exploration is only done in their heads, and only the parts deemed most important are vocalized or written down when presenting the decision.\nI propose that one way to judge the quality of a decision is by the decision maker\u0026rsquo;s ability to express their exploration of this tree. The fewer questions you can ask that are unanswered by the decision maker\u0026rsquo;s justification, the better.\nThis approach can be used in technical interviews, or judgment of someone\u0026rsquo;s work (e.g. when evaluating performance), by asking yourself \u0026ldquo;How much of the possibility space has this person explored?\u0026rdquo;.\n"},{"id":253,"href":"/docs/understanding-the-world/notetaking/","title":"Notetaking","section":"Docs","content":" Notes on Notetaking # References # https://tkainrad.dev/posts/managing-my-personal-knowledge-base/ https://vimways.org/2019/personal-notetaking-in-vim/ Graph Notetaking Idea # Use a set of nodes connected to other notes in a graph (like zettelkasten) to store knowledge.

Luckily, it is getting easier and easier to do this as technology becomes more and more efficient at sending data around the world. Unfortunately, simply gathering information is not enough; one must also make sure that the information is of high enough quality to use in world modeling or decision making.\nThere are many reasons why information people share with each other may be misleading or wrong.\nhttps://thedietwars.com/how-to-determine-who-is-a-legitimate-science-based-health-expert/\nStories # To transfer information, people share stories with each other. These stories get etched in people\u0026rsquo;s minds as they hear them, and can get more deeply etched with repetition or other validation.\nMany (technically most) stories are not accurate descriptions of the real, physical world.\nInaccurate stories can be useful. For instance, they can be \u0026ldquo;stepping stones to the truth\u0026rdquo;, like our story about how electrons are particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom (Bohr model). They can also provide practical ways to encourage a behavior; for instance, the story that virtuous people are rewarded in the afterlife. Or auervedic medicine promoting health.\nUnfortunately, inaccuracy can also lead to bad decision making with serious consequences. To be safe, it would be ideal if we could clearly determine inaccuracy and weight that in our consideration of whether or not to use the story in informing our behavior.\nStory Plausability vs Accuracy # Firstly, it is important to know that plausability DOES NOT correlate well with accuracy, especially in complex systems. This is true even when the plausible theory holds in controlled experiments done in a simplified version of the complex system (e.g. a model organism). There are many, many more plausable statements about systems like our economy or the human body that there are statements which are actually true. Some random examples (NOT MY OPINIONS):\nHealth # Any dietary sugar crystallizes in the blood, causing arterial damage. Sugar has no harmful effects on the body when \u0026lt;50g/day are consumed. Saturated fat hardens in the blood, clogging arteries. Saturated fat does not clog arteries, it gets dissolved in blood just fine. Economy # Poor people are poor because they don\u0026rsquo;t work hard. Poor people are poor because powerful people with malicious intent are taking their resources. Poor people are poor because our economy makes it hard to increase your net worth. Education # Girls and boys have inherent (from birth) differences in what topics they are interested in, and therefore end up finding careers in. Girls and boys have the same chance to become interested in something at birth, but are unevenly distributed in careers due to how they are raised. More theories like this that were widely believed but are now disproven can be found on this Wikipedia page. Also this study of medical therapies.\nNote that some stories can be completely true, but still not have the effect they imply. For instance, certain foods contain toxins that kill and/or mutate our cells. But this does not mean that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t eat those foods (perhaps every food falls into this category?).\nSee https://superbowl.substack.com/p/causal-explanations-considered-harmful for a good exploration of misleading causal theories.\nFor each of the above statements/stories, there are groups of people who would find them plausible. Since some directly contradict each other, how are we to know which to believe?\nThe Scientific Method # We can use scientific reasoning to falsify inaccurate stories! Ideally, we would do this for all information we incorporate into our decisions; if no one has tried to falsify a certain piece of information, then we probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use it for important decision making.\nUnfortunately, science is really hard, so many falsification studies have not been done. Additionally, science doesn\u0026rsquo;t give hard yes-or-no answers - it gives probabilities (e.g. p-values) that something might be true given a long list of assumptions or constraints. Context is crucially important - studies generally are very narrow in the situations they apply to! In order to accurately incorporate a scientific finding into a justification for making a certain decision, the uncertainties in the study and the required context to apply it should be understood.\nOh yeah, also scientific studies can just be wrong due to errors in their execution, even if the experimenters themselves were unbiased. A good practical way to get around this problem is to read review articles instead of individual studies.\nIt is hard to do this, just like it is hard to come up with scientific findings in the first place. If we as a society deeply recognized this difficulty, it may give more respect to good scientific findings, and help us have more informed debated about what actions to take on big important issues. This recognition may also make people more patient and willing to embrace the difficulty, instead of looking for shortcuts.\n(I have nothing against finding the most efficient ways to solve problems, except when these shortcuts are less rigorous or otherwise worse than harder solutions AND we pretend that they are just as good just because of their convenience).\nSee also:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper \u0026ldquo;The Beginning of Infinity\u0026rdquo; by David Deutsch People and Stories # When it comes to deciding what stories are accurate, or worth etching deeply into your own mind, it is important to select stories which have had a lot of effort put towards their falsification, but still hold up. To verify this process, it is ideal to try your hardest to falsify the story in question yourself.\nLooking at what others believe is a good way to find new stories, and also can be a good way to vet stories. It is crucial however to think about WHY believers trust the stories they do. If they have not actively tried to falsify their own stories, that is a red flag that their belief may not be sound. Evidence that people have tried this falsification includes:\nAdvertisement of conditions under which their story does not hold true. Write ups of experiments that were done in the effort of falsification. At a higher level, if the person in question has a history of changing their beliefs when shown new evidence, that is also a good sign.\nFor those people who have a long history of believing the same story, or have financial or social incentives to believe said story, be wary that their confirmation bias may blind them a bit to new information.\nIn extreme cases, people who do not try to falsify their own stories can become zealots; so blind to the limitation of their own beliefs that there is no practical difference between them and someone who is intentionally promoting a belief they know to be wrong (lying).\nOne thing to note is that people holding hard to old beliefs seems to be a natural thing for humans to do, and there are ways to exploit this without changing people\u0026rsquo;s minds:\nVSauce reasoning video_ Antifragile discusses how it might be ideal to have many strongly supported ideas fight it out in e.g. a market to find the best ones and move the whole system forward optimally. This is related to the idea of \u0026ldquo;science advances one funeral at a time\u0026rdquo;, which assumes that (1) famous accomplished sciences direct future research and (2) these scientists have entrenched beliefs. These things combined mean new research directions that do not fit into the beliefs of the accomplished scientists do not get funding/attention. It would be nice if this wasn\u0026rsquo;t as true, but at the least there is still advancement *shrug*.\nSee also the \u0026ldquo;Self Deception\u0026rdquo; section of Perspective.\nReasons People Share Ideas # Thinking about why an idea is being shared might make your decision of whether to believe it or not easier. Note that all of these reasons are extremely important and enable our modern society; I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that if you are listening to e.g. an advocate you can just ignore everything they are saying.\nTruth Sharing: Simply to share the truth to others, for them to do what they will with it. This type of sharing happens a lot in dense academic research papers that effectively just share numbers and contain very little interpretation. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to think you are doing this when you actually aren\u0026rsquo;t. Examples: Michael Lustgarten\u0026rsquo;s YouTube Channel Advocacy: To change the behavior of others. For instance, sharing pictures of smoker\u0026rsquo;s lungs to get people to stop smoking. Or to get atheists to accept God. Public health initiatives COVID vaccine advertisements Brainstorming/Theorizing: To get others to think about a problem or model of the world that might be useful or inaccurate. Partially in the hopes that others will find the model useful, and partially in the hopes that others will improve or soundly reject the model. \u0026ldquo;Why Greatness Cannot be Planned\u0026rdquo; by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman See also \u0026ldquo;The Enigma of Reason\u0026rdquo; for an excellent theory about how people reason to defend theories, not to generate them.\n\u0026ldquo;Experts\u0026rdquo; # Some fields, like chess, can legitimately have experts - people who deeply understand the problem space and make predictions about it very accurately. Other fields are less amenable to this - see Complex Systems.\nBelief Matrix # The following matrix provides a simplified view of how a person can stand on a single statement. The East/West axis describes how strongly the person agrees or disagrees with a statement. The North/South axis describes the level of evidence that person personally understands and accepts that supports the statement. Note that \u0026ldquo;scientific consensus\u0026rdquo; does not mean agreement of many trusted scientists, but rather the agreement of their work itself (e.g. compiled and reviewed by the person trying to form an opinion). Therefore, for example, if a person personally accepts strong evidence supporting the statement, yet disagrees with the statement, they must be lying.\nNote that it is very difficult to know the extent of understanding a person has about an issue. Therefore, it can be hard to distinguish between liars and skeptics, or even zealots supporting the counter-idea and liars. At least we can make some assumptions about the popularity/availability of scientific studies; if an \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; in a field ignores very available work, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely they are not an honest knowledge spreader.\nScientific Consensus Understood by Person ---------------------------------------------------- | | | | A Liar or propagandist | Someone spreading | | with hidden motives | real information | | (good or bad). | | ------------------A Plausible Idea------------------ | | | Vocal | A skeptic | A zealot or person | Vocal Disagreement | | with blind belief | Agreement | | | ------------------A Plausible Idea------------------ | | | | Someone spreading | A liar or propagandist | | real information | with hidden motives | | | (good or bad). | -------------------------------------------------- Scientific Rejection Understood by Person I personally believe the plausible idea (I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked for or found studies yet) that certain people can be more amenable to falling into a certain quadrant quickly when given some idea. And additionally, if someone is shown to be OK with lying about ideas in one area, they are probably more likely to do so in other areas as well. Probably then, if one wants to save time/energy/resources reviewing ideas, they could discount those that are supported by people who have lied or shown blind belief in other ideas.\nHowever, if one has the time and wants the most complete picture, in my opinion it is worth examining ideas from these people, since (again, in my opinion) it is very unlikely that they are completely incorrect in all their opinions. In fact, some of the most novel, and therefore potentially useful, ideas can come especially from strong believers in yet-untested plausible ideas.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash; OLD THOUGHTS BELOW HERE \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\nOne useful lens to look at this further is to think about where the shared information is ultimately coming from:\nFrom Past Personal Experience # What works # Tinkerers (as described in the book Antifragile) are people who use feedback from a specific task to improve and eventually become experts at doing that task. For instance a self-taught woodworker will eventually learn how to create complex wooden structures based on past experience of how wood behaves when he or she does things to it. Or a chess player may learn that certain patterns of pieces are dangerous or safe over time after winning or losing many games.\nInformation derived from tinkerers is:\nOften very practically useful Rarely completely \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, just maybe only right in a very narrow scope. But has these problems:\nDeeper theories or reasons behind why the information is what it is are often absent or unrecoverable. This limits the scope at which the information can be accurately applied. Reproducing the logic behind the information can be very difficult or impossible, since it requires walking though the life experience of the tinkerer. This can make it easy for the tinkerer to hide bias.
