  Solving Societal Problems
  #

Here I&rsquo;m defining a &ldquo;societal problem&rdquo; as a large problem facing many people
that could be solved if said people changed their behavior in some systematic
way. For example:

Climate Change could be solved if we all transitioned to using more
renewable sources of energy.
The Obesity Epidemic could be solved if we all ate less food.


  Individual Change and Shaming
  #

One common proposal I&rsquo;ve heard for solving at least the above problems is using
a &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; approach. This method would involve first changing your own
behavior such that the problem would be solved if everyone behaved like you,
then trying to influence others to adopt your new behavior(s). This seems
simple enough, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the best way forward, and in some ways is
actively harmful.">

This is most effective in simple systems with little\\nself-interaction (e.g. toy physics models).

I tried several exercises:\\n\\n - Dumbbell eccentric wrist extensions\\n   - These were time consuming to do and it was hard for me to notice them\\n     working my forearm or having any other real effect.\\n - [Hammer\\n   rotations](https://trainingforclimbing.com/treating-climbers-elbow-medial-epicondylitis/)\\n   - These felt effective, but only at high weight.\\n     Unfortunately, at high weight my left wrist also really started to hurt,\\n     making these not very viable to fix my problem.\\n - **Eccentric bicep curls (barbell or resistance bands)**\\n   - These are awesome!\\n     Very easy to do in a way that works my muscle, and seem to have a strong\\n     effect towards reducing my elbow pain.\\n     Plus they make my arms look strong while I am doing them :).\\n\\nSome more notes at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y8MYx9GGeIE7VZtD-RxeXZNkHAlSygasY8N6iRFDrv4.\"\n  :name \"injuries.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Climbing\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 1215\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755995343\n                                 1755409361]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Climbing\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/climbing/media.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Media\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Climbing\\\"}\\n---\\n# Climbing Media\\n\\n## My Experiences\\n\\nSee \\\"Climbing \u003e Event reports\\\" on the sidebar for a couple trip reports.\\n\\nI also gave an overview presentation to some colleagues at work, see [my\\nslides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AfhC_PR0d9JveDDStUo8NyT9wMPWAXF8UB3B3bsMCVs/edit?usp=sharing\u0026resourcekey=0-SdJHRlr5GhVkgTPE1CkMeQ)\\nfor details\\n\\n## Other Media\\n\\n* [Thai Climbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlB_4tOJqZ4)\\n* [Change 9b+ by Stefano Ghisolfi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8AETvINyAk\u0026ab_channel=StefanoGhisolfi)\\n* [The Arch by Irina Kuzmenko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_2t3b1-l1o\u0026ab_channel=mellow) - super cool looking problem!!\"\n  :name \"media.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Climbing\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 708\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1757135665\n                                 1756919393\n                                 1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1648002128\n                                 1647920983\n                                 1630546295\n                                 1613251448]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Climbing\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/climbing/resources.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Resources\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Climbing\\\"}\\n---\\n# Climbing Resources\\n\\n - https://www.mountainproject.com/international-climbing-grades\\n - https://climbingdangers.net/\\n - [Too Rainy To Climb](http://toorainy.com/) - weather forecast estimating how\\n   wet rock will be.\"\n  :name \"resources.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Climbing\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 273\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755995343\n                                 1755409361\n                                 1728452011\n                                 1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1653190047]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Climbing\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/climbing/routesetting.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Routesetting\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Climbing\\\"}\\n---\\n# Routesetting\\n\\n## 9/11/2025\\n\\nEvening set, played:\\n\\n - Wave Machine, Makari\\n - I Don't Know What I Am, Reliqa\\n - Slow Burn, Conquer Divide\\n - Rush, Maneskin\\n\\nSet 2 routes on overhanging tall wall rope 20.\\n\\n - Blue:\\n   - Dual texture big half moon holds.

This book makes the strong point that human beings are not inherently\\nperfectly disciplined, and will inevitably cut corners when doing a task many\\ntimes.  This is especially true when the corners that are cut are usually not\\nimportant, even if sometimes they are crucially so.\\n\\nReading this made me think of the process of climbing, which has many such\\nsteps.  So, in the interest of not skipping these steps myself, here is my\\nattempt at a *Manifesto* style checklist.  As in the book, I tried to make this\\nchecklist as useful and evidence driven as possible.  I'm hoping to make it\\nshort enough to be usable, yet not skipping any steps that commonly lead to\\ninjuries/death.\\n\\nBefore writing the checklist, I wanted to get an idea of what mistakes most\\ncommonly cause injuries when climbing.  According to [The epidemiology of\\nmountaineering and rock climbing\\naccidents](https://doi.org/10.1580/0953-9859-1.4.235), in Grand Teton National\\nPark from 1981 to 1986 these were:\\n\\n * Bad fall, usually on lead (34 cases).\\n * Rock fall when climbing (11 cases).\\n * Getting lost off route (6 cases).\\n * Rappelling off the rope end (1 case).\\n * Rappelling with a bad anchor (2 cases).\\n * Not using proper protection (7 cases).\\n * Not using a rope (4 cases)!\\n * Not wearing a helmet (3 cases).\\n\\nMost of the injuries discussed in the paper happened on snow/ice, which I'm\\nignoring for the purposes of this checklist.\\n\\nInterestingly, most of these injuries occurred on the easiest routes (5.1-5.3!),\\nwhich is in line with most of the anecdotes in *The Checklist Manifesto*.\\n\\nAnother study, [\\\"Rock climbing rescues in Boulder County, Colorado and Eldorado\\nCanyon State\\nPark\\\"](https://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(12)00109-3/fulltext), has\\nsimilar statistics. This study references [a similar Australian study](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://dokumen.tips/google-reader?url%3D1f38b04767057b7e61e6dc6a385532b059b9b5300a6f6922794715af97edb0c5608cd6855462c07b7ba9cea7b73d0370607ca69c30fd13c15abf5be6377add0d0l3DstEzNe1rGgKhO86Pa2B8IPxt6MgbB7vDfkU6/MsrdOoc4hxPjwR14utxof5RNCM++vnYL5Odac67f5xzvR2iiLMcwgP3Ulsaap3JrFaa6/vvh1ZZtnGJLHA9eH4nIknPKMtUfEBtFjzLPKxkRQ%3D%3D) with more interesting results.\\n\\nCheck [this cool data\\nvisualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nate.downer/viz/MostCommonAccidentCausebyState/Dashboard12)\\nusing American Alpine Club data for another view into accident data. And [this\\nvisualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nate.downer/viz/CausesofRockClimbingAccidents/MyRiskFactors)\\nby the same author.\\n\\nHere is the current checklist:\\n\\n```\\nBEFORE CLIMBING:\\n - Ensure harnesses are on correctly.\\n - Ensure belay device is locked and through two harness hard points.\\n - Ensure rope is tied through two harness hard points.\\n - Ensure rope has stopper knot at non-climber end.\\n - Determine if any extended slings will be needed to avoid rope running over\\n   rock.\\n - Discuss rock fall hazard and what to do if it happens.\\n\\nBEFORE RAPPELLING:\\n - Ensure both ends of rope have stopper knots.\\n - Weight rope while still using personal anchors.\\n```\\n\\nSee also https://climbingdangers.net/.\"\n  :name \"safety-checklist.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Climbing\"}\n  :dir?

Funnily enough some of our friends from the UW IMA had just\\nsummited a week before.*\\n\\nRappelling down was met with some trickiness at first; our first rope through\\nwent a bit off route and we needed to find our way back kinda awkwardly.  The\\nnext couple rappels were very straightforward, until we got to pitch 3. \\n\\n![Rappel Corner](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/rappel-corner-pitch.jpg)\\n\\nFirstly, this pitch was very long to rappel.  I remember having to daisy-chain\\nsome quickdraws together in order to keep a hold of both rope ends, but still\\ncouldn't make it all the way to the anchors.  Instead I had to stop at this\\ntree with a sling around it (perhaps others had the same issue).\\n\\n![Up Pitch 3](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/up-pitch-3.jpg)\\n\\nOnce Matthew had also rappelled down, we decided to pull the rope through and\\nbelay each other off the tree as we walked down to the ~20ft away anchors.\\nThis is where we ran into another snag:\\n\\nSo far, I had been rappelling down the climb with this technique:\\n\\n![GriGri Rappel](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/grigri-rappel.jpg)\\n*Image source: https://ropeandsummit.wordpress.com/technique/belaying-rappeling/*\\n\\nThis allowed me to use my GriGri for a more comfortable and safer rappel.\\nUnfortunately, this method had the before unforseen drawback of making it much\\neasier for the rope to get stuck in constrictions when pulling it through.\\nThis is exactly what happened when pulling our rope through on this pitch.  Our\\nknot got stuck about 5 feet from the upper anchor, and no amount of wiggling\\nand pulling would set it free!\\n\\nVery very luckily, the other end of the rope was still in reach.  I was able to\\ngrab it, pull it down, attach my GriGri, and then part climb/part jug up the\\nwhole climb back to the anchors.  I noticed a clear spot where the knot had\\ngotten stuck.  I am extremely grateful that this spot was not further down the\\nclimb; had we not been able to use the other rope end to climb up we would have\\nbeen very stuck.  I then set up a more traditional rappel, rappelled down, and\\npulled the rope with no issues.\\n\\nThis extra \\\"climb\\\" burned even more time, and now we were very eager to make a\\nhasty descent.  We quickly finished the rest of our rappels and started\\nscrambling back to the trail over the talus fields.\\n\\n![Looking Back](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/looking-back.jpg)\\n\\nBy the time we had reached the trail proper, the sun was already (beautifully)\\nsetting.\\n\\n![Sunset](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/sunset.jpg)\\n\\nWith the solid trail beneath our feet, we started moving faster, breaking\\nalmost into a jog as the trail got flatter.  On the way down, we passed a very\\ntired, but very chilled out family hiking up on a backpacking trip.  Their\\ncalming influence was very welcome.\\n\\nOnce we had made it into the forest, we had to pull out our phone flashlights,\\nas it was now completely dark.  We managed to do this part of the trail in\\nrecord time, only getting lost a bit on the largest river crossing.  Luckily we\\nwere both able to quickly retrace our steps and re-locate the trail on the\\nother side of the river without too much more time.\\n\\nWe got to the car around 9:30pm and drove as quickly as we could to get back to\\nour campsite just after they closed at 10pm.  The gatekeeper took pity on us\\nand let us in without a fine or any other trouble.  Our fellow campers were\\npretty worried about us though.  Reflecting back on our botch rappel this trip\\nmade me realize that I really want to either have cell service or a satellite\\ncommunication device the next time I go on a trip like this.\\n\\nBesides our rushed finish, this climb was truly spectacular. It was also a\\ngreat sport -\u003e alpine climbing introduction.  I wouldn't go so far as to call\\nit \\\"pleasure climbing\\\" like a roped soloer we met two days before at Mt. Erie\\ncalled it, but it was a really cool alpine climbing experience.  Just make sure\\nyou give yourself enough time!\\n\\n![Matthew Looking Back](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/matthew-looking-back.jpg)\"\n  :name

hiker walking on this very\\nsnowfield.\\nThe hiker fell through the snow and was swept downhill by the water, only being\\nsaved by a lucky constriction in the underground river.\\nMade me glad I was on the rocks.\\n\\nI noticed some climbers on a route to the left of me, on a beautiful very\\nexposed spire.\\nI also noticed a mountain goat and excitedly gestured towards it to some\\nclimbers at the base.\\nThey didn't seem very excited and later I felt a bit silly, as the goats were\\neverywhere over the pass.\\nIn fact, for the next couple miles there would always be at least one in

exciting moment where we needed to cross a pretty steep\\nsnowfield.\\nI was first, and I tried to follow some goat tracks that made their way across.\\nAs I was crossing, I slipped into an

Walkie talkies would have been very useful for communication on the climb,\\n   and possibly even on the hike depending on their range.\\n - Staying as high as possible on the rappel down from the climb may have given\\n   us some opportunities to avoid the steep snowfields.\\n - Someone in our group had a Garmin watch which showed our exact position on a\\n   map and our progress on an elevation gain chart.\\n   This was very nice to refer to every so often to satisfy curiosity.\\n - My boots got very wet after the first day of hiking, and I had trouble drying\\n   them for the rest of the trip.\\n   Next time I should bring a second pair of shoes besides climbing shoes, and\\n   do some research about the best way to dry boots overnight in the wilderness.\"\n  :name \"2024-7-enchantments-prusik-peak.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Climbing\"\n                \"Event Reports\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 17451\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755995343\n                                 1755409361\n                                 1740866322\n                                 1740862760\n                                 1740859090\n                                 1740853128\n                                 1740814356\n                                 1740814083\n                                 1740813541\n                                 1740812280]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Climbing\"\n                     \"Event Reports\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/climbing/event-reports/first-512.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"First 512\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Climbing\\\" \\\"Event Reports\\\"}\\n---\\n# My First 5.12!\\n\\nI projected this route for a while and still can remember its movements.\\nPosting it here mostly for my own personal nostalgia : ).\\n\\nHere is the route: https://photos.app.goo.gl/fvva4kiMPeRbi6tP9.\"\n  :name \"first-512.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Climbing\"\n                \"Event Reports\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 283\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1742167498\n                                 1741372686\n                                 1662924312\n                                 1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1613251448]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Computers\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/computers/my-computer-configuration.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"My Computer Configuration\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Lifestyle Optimizations\\\" \\\"Computers\\\"}\\n---\\n# My Computing Environment\\n\\nMy complete configuration files (\\\"dotfiles\\\") can be found at\\nhttps://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles.  \\n\\n## Color and Brightness {#color-brightness}\\n\\n### Temperature {#temperature}\\n\\nI find that dim screens make it easier for me to read and work for longer\\nwithout straining or fatiguing my eyes.  Therefore, I generally keep my screen\\nat a low brightness level.  \\n\\n#### On Linux\\n\\nI use [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) to\\nkeep my screen at a low temperature (low 3000Ks).  Currently I use a constant\\ntemperature all the time, as opposed to making the color lower at night.\\n\\n#### On Windows\\n\\nI use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) with default settings (changing color over\\nthe day).  I frequently mess with the color temperature slider based on what I am doing.\\n\\n### Selective Window Brightness {#selective-brightness}\\n\\n#### On Linux\\n\\nI prefer dark, lower contrast color schemes for coding or working on the command\\nline.  They feel easier on my eyes and allow for more variety of color for use\\nin (for example) syntax highlighting.  I find that colors blend into light\\nbackgrounds more, and are therefore less readable.  \\n\\nHowever, most documents in the world are rendered with black text on a white\\nbackground.  I find this perfectly readable, but starkly different from my dark\\ncolor schemes.  This makes it quite jarring to switch between the two, which I\\noften do when I'm writing or coding while looking at a reference document in my\\nweb browser.  \\n\\nTo fix this issue, I've tried a couple things:\\n\\n- Using a page dimmer in my web browser.\\n  - This is generally a good solution, but (since these usually inject dimming\\n    javascript or css into the page that is being viewed) does not work when\\n    viewing web browser settings or reading pdfs or using any UI that is not\\n    strictly on the page.\\n- Boosting the brightness of my terminal and dimming everything globally.\\n  - Works for all light colored programs!\\n  - The best way I could find to do this was to take the colors in the terminal\\n    colorscheme (as hex strings) and increase their brightness value to make new\\n    hex string colors, which I used as my colorscheme.  This definitly makes the\\n    terminal brighter but, as the brightness goes up, colors start maxing out\\n    util they all become white (#ffffff).  I wasn't able to boost brightness\\n    enough with this trick while keeping my colors distinct.\\n\\nThe current solution I have is to selectively apply color filters to different\\nprograms using [Compton](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compton).  This is\\nnot a feature that Compton supports natively, so I had to apply a patch I found\\n[here](https://github.com/chjj/compton/issues/266).  The patched code can be\\nfound [here](https://github.com/kovasap/compton).  To configure this method, you\\ncan add shaders (functions that change pixel colors) to the\\n`compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl` file in the root of that\\nrepository.  I run it by adding this to my `~/.xinitrc`:\\n\\n```\\n~/.xinitrc\\n---\\ncompton --glx-prog-win-rule ~/compton/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl:'class_g=\\\"Google-chrome\\\"' --backend glx -b\\n```\\n\\nAnother idea I had to help fix my problem was to selectively dim brighter\\npixels, while keeping dimmer pixels unchanged.  I read that using the\\n[HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) color encoding could provide a\\ngood way to define what \\\"brighter\\\" means and a way to change it.  Luckily, \\nCompton provided a easy way to mess with this!  My fiddling can be found in the\\n[`compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl`](https://github.com/kovasap/compton/blob/94efb6c9a1f80e8dbf61409dfa9b476f15a06a16/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl#L64)\\nfile in my fork of the Compton repository. One thing I tried here was to use a\\nfunction like\\n[this](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+x+*+(1+-+a+*+x)+for+a%3D0,0.1,0.2,0.3,+x%3D0.0..1.0)\\nto map the \\\"value\\\" (V in HSV) to a dimmer value (notice how higher `V` values\\nare \\\"dimmed\\\" more than lower ones).  \\n\\nOne fun tool for this experimentation was a color picker like\\n[this](https://alloyui.com/examples/color-picker/hsv.html) one.  When changing\\nthe shader, the 2d color picker would have its colors changed, verifying the\\nchange made in the shader!  For example, after setting the shader to map `V`\\nvalues above 0.8 to 0.0, I could see the part of the color picker with those\\nvalues turn black.\\n\\nIn the end, I may just stick with selectively dimming entire bright windows\\nglobally, as opposed to dimming certain colors.  But it was fun to mess with and\\nI may return to it in the future!\\n\\nAnother thing to try going forward would be other color representation models,\\nsuch as [CIELAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) or\\n[YCbCr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr).\\n\\nUPDATE: One promising solution is https://github.com/yshui/picom/pull/247. This\\nfeature for picom (a fork of compton) gets an average brightness for a window\\nby averaging the colors of all its pixels, then dims the window if that\\nbrightness is above a threshold. It didn't work super well in my hands, but is\\nin theory a better solution to this problem than dimming all windows of a\\ncertain app.\\n\\n#### On Windows\\n\\nBecause I often game on windows, I prefer to have my secondary monitor be dimmer\\nthan the primary to not distract from the game I'm playing, but still be there to\\nlook stuff up.  I use the exellent [Pangolin Screen Brightness](https://www.pangobright.com/)\\nutility to do this.\\n\\n\\n## TODO\\n\\nTo link this documentation more with my actual config, one idea is to add\\nsomething like this to all the settings I document in my rc files:\\n\\n```\\n## SETTING_NAME ##\\nsome code that applies a setting\\n## END ##\\n```\\n\\nThen, when I'm writing docs in this website I can simply reference the\\nSETTING_NAME instead of inlining the code.  To make this work I need to write\\ncode that parses all my rc files and constructs some kind of mapping from\\nSETTING_NAMES to the code (and the language to get syntax highlighting right and\\nthe filename).

This is important to me enough to think about because I commute by\\nbike. Dodging the rain is really nice when possible so that I don't get as wet\\non the way to work.\\n\\n**Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much correlation at all with time of\\nday and precipitation.** Read on to see how I discovered this...\\n\\n## Data\\n\\nI thought I'd try answering the question once and for all by looking at some\\nweather station data.  I first tried getting data via this service:\\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets.  Unfortunately, the data I got was\\npretty inconsistent. I talked to a meteorologist from NOAA via their help email\\nand was redirected to some [beta\\ndata](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/hpd/auto/v2/beta/15min/). For this\\ndata, I needed to pick a station, so I looked in the `hpd-stations-inventory`\\nfile and found a list of Washington stations with coordinates. I loaded these\\nup using [Google Maps](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/102780) and found\\nthat the Everett station was the closest one to Seattle (there was no station\\nin Seattle proper 🙁). Then I found and downloaded the file corresponding to\\nthis station ID (USC00452675).\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\nI analyzed the data using plotly with [this\\ncode](https://github.com/kovasap/weather-data). This code calculates the\\nprobability that it will rain in all the historical data during any given\\n15-minute interval and plots that number, with error bars given as the standard\\ndeviation.  I first did data from 2019-2021 for speed of processing...\\n\\n{{\u003c plotly json=\\\"/USC00452675.15m.2019-2021.csv.json\\\" height=\\\"1800px\\\" \u003e}}\\n\\n...and I saw some trends! Especially in August and July it looked like it\\ndidn't ever rain in the afternoon. This got me excited to think I'd learned\\nsomething, so I ran with more data (2000-2021)...\\n\\n{{\u003c plotly json=\\\"/USC00452675.15m.2000-2021.csv.json\\\" height=\\\"1800px\\\" \u003e}}\\n\\n...and everything averaged out 😦.\"\n  :name \"seattle-rain.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Datavis\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 2149\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1654656439\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1629568468]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Gaming\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/gaming/buying-games.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Buying Games\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Gaming\\\"}\\n---\\n# Buying PC Games\\n\\n## [isthereanydeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/)\\n\\nStore aggregation site where you can search for the best game prices across\\nmany stores.

I'm writing them here so I don't forget them, and so others might learn\\nsomething - or point out flaws in my reasoning so I can get better!\\n\\n## Information, and Proactivity\\n\\nMost FPS fights come down to proactively acting on information about where\\nexactly your opponent is. If you know with precision where your opponent is,\\nand they don't know where you are, you can confidently peek at them and often\\neven prefire (or shoot as you are peeking).  Even if your aim is worse, you\\nwill most of the time win the fight because your opponent has to reactively (1)\\nnotice you, (2) readjust their aim (often \u003e90 degrees of turning), and then (3)\\nshoot - whereas you get to skip the first two steps.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are peeking off of an information advantage, you also have\\nthe benefit of controlling the timing of the fight. Since you are peeking\\naround cover, you can always easily reverse your peek and duck back behind\\ncover if needed to reload or retreat.  This gives yet another massive advantage\\nto you.\\n\\nUsually, proactively peeking someone involves you moving, but it can sometimes\\ninvolve you staying still in an unexpected place and using audio cues to\\nanticipate an enemy coming into view.  Here, even though you are not moving,\\nyou are still the proactive party - your opponent is reacting to you.  Of\\ncourse, for this to work, you must be sure your opponent doesn't know where you\\nare, otherwise they will peek you and almost certainly win since they control\\nthe timing of the fight.\\n\\n## Getting and Keeping an Information Advantage\\n\\nTo win as many fights as possible, it's crucial to take those fights with an\\ninformation advantage. But how do you get this advantage and keep it as much as\\npossible?\\n\\n### The Cone of Danger\\n\\nThe most useful way I've found to do this is to always hold in your head a\\nmodel of where your opponents might be.  One way to think about this is a \\\"cone\\nof danger\\\".  Imagine you can see through the walls of the map you are playing\\non.  Then draw a cone from the leftmost enemy all the way to the rightmost\\nenemy.  This is the \\\"cone of danger\\\" you need to expect you opponents to be in.\\nPractically, since you normally cannot see through walls, you'll need to\\nconstantly estimate this, drawing the cone from corners enemies could peek out\\nat you from.\\n\\n![Cone Start](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_start.png)\\n\\nIdeally, you want to keep this code as small as possible:\\n\\n![Cone Small](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_small.png)\\n\\nwhile making your opponent's cone as large as possible:\\n\\n![Cone Large](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_large.png)\\n![Cone Max](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_max.png)\\n\\nThe best way to do this is by making it possible for yourself to move around\\nyour opponent freely without them seeing you, while making it so any movement\\nthey make is detectable by you. This generally involves controlling (knowing\\nfor certain no enemies are in) most of the map.\\n\\nPractically, moving around a lot also helps mess with your opponents cone. Even\\nif you have the ability to move around your opponent freely, your opponent will\\noften make the assumption you stayed still - if they are right, then they have\\na very small cone when they go to peek you. A good practice is to always move\\nafter an enemy sees you if possible.\\n\\nDifferent games provide different tools to help determine where opponents are.\\nUse these!\\n\\n### Stealth vs Spotted Mode\\n\\nOne helpful thought pattern is always knowing if you are operating in \\\"stealth\\nmode\\\" or in \\\"spotted mode\\\".\\n\\nIn \\\"stealth mode\\\", your opponents don't know where you are. When in stealth\\nmode, the goal is to get into a position where you can get some free shots in on\\nyour opponents from an angle they aren't looking at. Once you do get those shots\\nin, or are otherwise spotted, you immediately transition to \\\"spotted mode\\\".\\n\\nIn \\\"spotted mode\\\", your opponents know your position and (you should assume)\\nthey are taking steps to peek you as unpredictably as they can. Here, the\\nprimary goal is to get back to either the safety of your teammates or a hidden\\nlocation in which you can't easily be trapped (e.g. a room with many exits as\\nopposed to one or two).\\n\\nBecause the transition between stealth mode and spotted mode is so instant, it's\\nhelpful to always keep in mind an escape route when you are in stealth mode,\\njust in case you are spotted. This is for instance why a flank like this can be\\nbad:\\n\\n```\\n\u003cT\u003e           |        \u003cO\u003e\\n     \u003cT\u003e      |      \u003cO\u003e          |   \u003cYou\u003e\\n                     \u003cO\u003e\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\u003cT\u003e = Teammate\\n\u003cO\u003e = Opponent\\n\u003cYou\u003e = You\\n| or - = cover\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, even if you get a free kill from surprise, your opponents could easily surround and 3v1 you once you are spotted.\\n\\nIt may be better to take an approach like this:\\n\\n```\\n\u003cT\u003e           |        \u003cO\u003e\\n     \u003cT\u003e      |      \u003cO\u003e\\n                     \u003cO\u003e\\n\\n                |\\n\\n                    -------\\n\\n                   \u003cYou\u003e\\n```\\n\\nHere at the very least once you are spotted you have a clear, safe path back to\\nyour teammates.\\n\\nOf course, doing a 180 degree flank may be totally fine if you have some other\\nway to escape, either due to some map feature or character ability.\\n\\n## Peeking Unknown Corners\\n\\nIf you are peeking around a corner into an unknown area with many potential\\nenemy locations, it's best to jiggle peak back and forth around the corner\\nchecking each individual location one-by-one. This will help make sure you are\\nnot fighting multiple enemies at once, and will give you control over fight\\ntiming.  Be careful that this can be difficult when close to a corner, since\\nevery unit of movement you make will expose a lot more of you than if you were\\nfurther from the corner.\\n\\n## Cover\\n\\nIn games like Apex Legends, it's a good principle to keep part of your screen\\nobscured by cover when fighting, to give your opponent a smaller area to hit. At\\nthe very least, make it so that when you are peeking out of cover you are also\\nshooting - this way worst case you are trading damage one-to-one with your\\nopponent.\\n\\n## Angle Types\\n\\nWhoever is closest to an angle has a disadvantage when fighting, as their body will be exposed before their opponent's.  Therefore, when holding an angle, it's helpful to be as far away from the piece of cover you expect your opponent to peek out from.  This also makes you a smaller target.\\n\\nIf you must hold close to an angle, you have to bank on your opponent not being thoughough and hide very passively, or be ready to aggresively peek with a close range weapon based on a sound cue.\\n\\n## Influences\\n\\n - [Great break down by CoachNihil of kandyrew's\\n   gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4QuNEkLtl8\u0026ab_channel=kandyrew)\\n   which helped inspire the \\\"cone of danger\\\" thinking.\"\n  :name \"fps-principles.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Gaming\"}\n  :dir?

Often, the state will become even better with each update that the\\nlast update made it; the rate of state betterment per step is convex.  In the\\nend, the state may be able to \\\"go infinite\\\" or otherwise reach some victory\\ngame state in one turn.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n - The game board is an engine in Magic: TG.\\n - The player boards + cards in Agricola.\\n - The player boards in Wingspan.\\n \\n\\n## Knowledge Building\\n\\nPlaying through the games gives insight that allows progression.\\nOne way to identify this is to compare how long it would take to complete the\\ngame on the first playthrough vs the second.\\nIf the second playthrough would be much faster, then knowledge building is a\\nlarge part of the game.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n - Outer Wilds\\n - Roguelikes\\n\\n\\n## Trial-Discovery Game Loop\\n\\nOne very satisfying game loop goes like this:\\n\\n1. The game presents a difficult trial or puzzle\\n1. After completing the trial, the player is rewarded with a discovery like:\\n   1. a new part of the story\\n   1. some new mechanics to play with\\n   1. new customization options for character building or more generally future\\n      trial preparation\\n1. Back to step 1\\n\\nIn my opinion, for the loop to work well, the trial must be hard. This can be\\nhard to implement in a game with lots of customization options (some builds\\nmight trivialize trials, and some may make them impossible). In this case what\\nI've seen work the best is games that make trials on the harder side, but also\\nprovide intermediate content for players to do to e.g. level up their party.\\nThis way, players with builds that aren't working as well can choose to just\\nget stronger to the point where their build does work. And players with good\\nbuilds are rewarded by making it through the discovery loop faster.\\n\\nGames that do this really well both with story and with character customization\\nin my opinion include:\\n\\n - [Fell Seal - Arbiter's Mark]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/gaming/games/tactics-rpg/fell-seal-arbiters-mark.md\\\" \u003e}})\\n - [XCOM 2]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/gaming/games/tactics-rpg/XCOM-2-+-War-of-the-Chosen.md\\\" \u003e}})\\n\\n## Urgency\\n\\nSome sense that the player needs to do something to avoid loss is important to\\navoid players getting bored.

Then everyone just makes the agreed\\nupon move. This effectively turns a \\\"multiplayer\\\" game into a complex \\\"single\\nplayer\\\" experience, where the single player is a group trying to come to\\nconsensus. Another way to say this is that the game starts getting **\\\"played by\\ncommittee\\\"**.\\n\\nThis is not in-itself a problem, but it does lead to some issues:\\n\\n - Often a few people end up leading the group, and effectively playing the\\n   game for everyone else.\\n - If leaders don't emerge, it takes a lot of time to get everyone on the same\\n   page about a specific plan of action, which can make the game tedious.\\n\\n## A Solution: Secret Objectives\\n\\n[Dead of Winter]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/gaming/games/cooperative-rpg/dead-of-winter.md\\\" \u003e}}) gets\\naround this problem partially by giving players secret objectives that may be\\ndirectly in conflict. This and some other mechanics make the game play more\\nlike a \\\"normal\\\" competitive game.\\n\\n## A Solution: Communication Limiting\\n\\nAn elegant solution to the above problem (which I haven't tried yet), is to put\\nconstraints on the communication that can be done between players during the\\ngame.  Some ways of doing this include:\\n\\n - Only letting players controlling characters that are physically close\\n   together on the board to speak to each other. This is very easily done with\\n   chat apps (Discord, SMS, etc.).\\n - Putting a time limit (or character limit) on communication. If the limit is\\n   exceeded, then the players will lose turns - their characters were spending\\n   time talking instead of acting.\\n\\nThese options are interesting because they produce a trade off - is it better\\nfor our actions to be more in sync, or should we just act with less\\nsynchronization?\\n\\nGame mechanics could also play into this communication limitation - for\\ninstance, characters that can communicate telepathically with others may be\\nimmune to any limits.\\n\\n\\n## Comments from coworker to integrate\\n\\nI guess you might break it up into a few more parts\\n* Permission (can I talk to this person at all)\\n* Duration (how much time can I communicate with this person)\\n* Dictionary-space (how much vocabulary do I have to communicate)\\n\\nPhysical closeness 'permission' and time-limit per-action/turn you cover,\\nhowever there are two things I might add that limit effectiveness of\\ncommunication:\\n* Role-playing\\n* Language limits\\n\\nWith roleplaying, while it may be optimal to take a course of action, it may\\nnot be what the character would do (for example, against a demon and a lich it\\nmay be optimal to disrupt the lich's spellcasting, but your character may have\\nhatred of demons).  This is most applicable in TTRPGs like D\u0026D and Pathfinder\\nand less applicable in Video Games or some Board Games.   This doesn't limit\\ntheoretical communication, but may limits it's impact depending on your group.\\n\\nLanguage limits the dictionary of what can be said, but doesn't necessarily\\nlimit how much can be said within that dictionary.  For example, Gloomhaven\\nbefore your two cards are selected limits communication to 'relative' values\\n(ex. I am going as fast as possible and will do an AoE) rather than absolutes\\n(ex. I am moving with Mana Bolt at 07 initiative and will top with coldfire).\\nThis still lets people communicate freely, but can limit knowledge.  This also\\nencourages players building knowledge of each others abilities and what they do\\nin combat, somewhat like a small group of mercenaries would.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Mechanic Ideas]({{\u003c relref \\\"/\\\" \u003e}}?Mechanic-Ideas=true)\"\n  :name \"limiting-collaboration.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Gaming\"\n                \"Gamedev\"\n                \"Mechanic Ideas\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/gaming/games/cooperative-rpg/dead-of-winter.md\"\n          \"/\"]\n  :size 4056\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755995343\n                                 1755449988\n                                 1755449404\n                                 1755412331]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Gaming\"\n                     \"Gamedev\"\n                     \"Mechanic Ideas\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/gaming/gamedev/mechanic-ideas/low-friction-turn-based-tactics.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Low Friction Turn Based Tactics\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Gaming\\\" \\\"Gamedev\\\" \\\"Mechanic Ideas\\\"}\\n---\\n# Minimizing UI Friction in Turn Based Tactics Games\\n\\n## One-click actions\\n\\nGames like XCOM, Fire Emblem, Warhammer 40k Mechanicus, Gloomhaven Digital etc.\\nsometimes have a problem with requiring many clicks/actions from the player to\\nexecute actions.  To minimize this, you could have the player's options for\\nwhat a character should do on a tile appear as a button on that tile. For\\nmultiple actions these buttons could be arranged in a grid.\\n\\nFor example, a character could move to an empty tile (just one option with one\\nbutton).  Or if they could cast an aoe ability on that tile then on hover that\\ntile would have two buttons.  Clicking one would automatically take that\\naction.\\n\\nWhen hovering an enemy, buttons would appear for each type of attack the\\ncharacter could do.  For out of range enemies, a shadow movement could appear\\nwhen hovering to make the attack possible with just one click!\\n\\n## Show Ability Effect On Hover\\n\\nAnother common annoyance I run into in turn based games is how many individual\\nchecks I sometimes have to do when making a decision for a character's action.\\nFor instance, if I want to find out which enemy I want to attack, I usually need\\nto go through each possible enemy in range, start the attack process, review the\\ndamage/probability/other effect preview window, then remember that information so that I\\ncan compare it to every other possible action I have.  This is sometimes really\\ntrivial (when there is a single enemy, for instance), but sometimes really involved\\nto the point where I need to start double checking the preview windows as I forget\\nwhat they contained.\\n\\nOne way to solve this is to show a small pop-up preview window on top of every\\npossible target when hovering over a skill/attack/spell. This mock-up shows a simple\\nexample of a healing spell with only the amount healed shown.  In practice, you would\\nalso want to show probability to hit, any effects the spell applies (e.g. poison), etc.\\n\\n![Hoverable outcomes](/docs/gamedev/mechanic-ideas/hoverable-outcomes-healing.png)\\n\\nThis example is overly simple and doesn't fully show the usefulness of this feature. In\\na real game, the diversity of outcomes would be much greater most of the time.\\n\\n### Enemy abilities\\n\\nOne extension of this feature is to make it so that when hovering over an enemy the same\\npop-up preview window would appear on all the squares it can target (even with moving).\\nThe window would contain that enemy's current intent given the state of the game, which\\nwould change as you moved your characters around.  This would make it easier to see what\\nenemies are capable of, and would make it less likely that the player would get blindsided\\nby something they didn't think was possible, which is a bad experience especially if it leads\\nto the player reloading the encounter.\\n\\nAdmittedly, this might be pretty hard to implement completely depending on the game's rules.\\nEven if this isn't implemented, games that are wholly lacking any way to see what enemies can\\ndo (what effects their attacks will have on your characters) besides doing all the math yourself\\nI find very tedious (see the turn-based modes for Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity 2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Mechanic Ideas]({{\u003c relref \\\"/\\\" \u003e}}?Mechanic-Ideas=true)\"\n  :name \"low-friction-turn-based-tactics.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Gaming\"\n                \"Gamedev\"\n                \"Mechanic Ideas\"}\n  :dir?

Requires Godot engine to\\nplay currently (I haven't made release builds). The current version is probably\\nbroken - I left off at adding a side-scrolling background for moving to the\\nnext fight, but haven't finished it yet.\\n\\nMostly inspired by the development of SNKRX at https://github.com/a327ex/SNKRX.\\n\\n\\n## Farming Turn Based Tactics Game\\n\\nCode can be found at https://github.com/kovasap/farming_strategy_game. Inspired\\nby resource management board games, and turn based tactics games.

a \\\"Nugget Climbing\\\"\\npodcast episode that talks a lot about the health in America.\\nThis episode specifically focused a lot on RFK, jr., a quintessential\\n\\\"alt-health\\\"-er who has just come to some power in the Trump administration.\\n\\nIn the episode, the host tells a story about how he had psoriasis on the back of\\nhis head.\\nHe describes going to a doctor, being told the condition was untreatable, and\\nbeing given a steroid to apply topically for the rest of his life to manage\\nsymptoms.\\nThen, the host describes how he started reading more \\\"alt-health\\\" content and\\nstarted experimenting with his diet.\\nMiraculously, this experimentation led to a dramatic reduction in symptoms (much\\nmore than the steroid)!\\nThe host concludes his story by discussing how this experience made him feel a\\nbit betrayed by the healthcare system, and much more interested in \\\"alt-health\\\"\\ntakes.\\n\\nFunnily enough, I have a story from my own life that almost perfectly parallels\\nthe host's.\\nIn high school I played football and wore these tight padded undershorts 5+ days\\na week for practice and games.\\nI think something about this triggered a bad eczema on my inner thighs that\\npersisted for about a decade after I stopped playing football.\\nLike the host, I went to a doctor and had the exact same experience: \\\"your\\ncondition is incurable, here is a steroid\\\".\\nThen, like the host, I started reading about and experimenting with diet, and\\nalso made my eczema completely go away.\\nFor me, it seemed like eliminating dairy from my diet was the main driver of my\\ncure.\\n\\nI also felt a bit betrayed by the doctor - the word \\\"incurable\\\" so strongly\\nechoed in my mind and made me feel terrible and defeatist about my condition.\\nThe fact that it was in fact curable despite what the doctor said was a relief,\\nbut also made me feel bad that I had to live with the defeatist attitude about\\nan uncomfortable condition for so long.\\n\\n## Interlude: Effect Size\\n\\nBefore going into different influences of health, I want to quickly describe\\nwhat I find to be a useful way to rank these influences: comparing effect size.\\n\\nEffect size is simply the size of the effect you expect a health intervention to\\nhave.\\nFor instance, for me, eliminating dairy made my eczema go from 100% to 0%, a\\nlarge effect.\\nI have yet to notice any effect from Vitamin D supplements I've been recently\\ntaking, but soon I'll have a blood test that will quantify how much my blood\\nlevels have changed (hopefully due to the supplement...).\\nThis effect size hopefully I'll be able to map to health outcomes I actually\\ncare about.\\n\\nResearchers use effect size to describe the efficacy of drugs or other\\ninterventions so that they can be approved (or banned) for general use by a body\\nlike the FDA.\\n\\nNote that it is quite common for there to be a reasonable explanation for why\\nsomething should impact health (e.g. a molecular mechanism), but for the actual\\neffect size to be zero or even negative.\\nMany, many billions of dollars are continuously and painfully spent on drug\\ntrials that fail in probably the best illustration of this phenomenon.\\n\\nKeeping effect size in mind is a good way to consistency judge things that\\nimpact health, and helps prevent getting distracted by the reasonable\\nexplanations.\\n\\n## Specificity: An Alt-Health Tendency\\n\\nAs I have read books and articles about how to be healthier, emboldened by my\\neczema cure, I have noticed some worrying trends in the alt-health space.\\nSpecifically, it seems many alt-health-ers love to pick out very specific causes\\nof health problems without evidence of a noticeable effect size in real people.\\nThese include:\\n\\n - MSG and \\\"excitotoxins\\\"\\n - Glyphosate and other herbicides\\n - \\\"GMO\\\" foods\\n - Non-organic foods generally\\n - [Seed oils](https://dynomight.net/seed-oil/)\\n - Preservatives\\n - \\\"Anti-nutrients\\\" like oxalates and phytates\\n - Microplastics and teflon\\n\\nI see this happening for interventions that benefit health too:\\n\\n - Most supplements (flagship example: resveratrol)\\n - Some specific diets that make sweeping generalizations, like the blood type\\n   diet\\n\\nIt's entirely possible that some of these things actually do have a measurable\\neffect size that I haven't found in the literature yet; if they do please let me\\nknow!\\n\\nI suspect people keep doing this for several reasons, depending on the\\ncause/intervention:\\n\\n1. Because it is neat and simple to say \\\"if we only got rid of this, we would be\\n   so much healthier\\\".\\n2. The reasonable explanations (not based on scientific data) are convincing.\\n3. A low level disgust response.\\n   \\\"Eating plastic\\\" sounds bad to the primitive parts of our brain.\\n\\n## Unspecific Cures\\n\\nTo be fair, many \\\"alt-health\\\"-ers (like me) are also big fans of less \\\"specific\\\"\\ninterventions that **do** have a well studied and measurable effect size.\\nThese include:\\n\\n - Daily exercise, low and high intensity\\n - A sufficient amount of good quality sleep\\n - Consumption of whole foods like:\\n   - Fruits\\n   - Vegetables\\n   - Whole grains\\n   - Fish\\n   - Meat (controversial), including stuff beyond muscle like organs\\n - Avoiding processed foods and hyper-palatable foods that make it easy to\\n   overeat.\\n   Note that these foods can be helpful if you require them to stay in energy\\n   balance, such as when being very physically active.\\n - Avoiding chronic stress, e.g. from a stressful job, social media, and/or\\n   their commute.\\n   Or at least being able to manage stress well.\\n - Avoiding chronic exposure to poor air quality, including smoking\\n - Avoiding excess alcohol consumption\\n - Avoiding chronic high blood pressure, e.g. from high salt/stress\\n - Avoiding heart disease risk markers, like high apoB, e.g. from diet\\n\\n## Big Pharma and Doctors: Corrupted?\\n\\nMany alt-health-ers have a strong distaste of the pharma industry, and use of\\ndrugs in general.\\nIn the most extreme case, their story is that pharma companies only care about\\nprofit, and would prefer to keep many people in a state of chronic disease\\nmanaged by drugs to make the most money.\\nAdditionally, the story goes that doctors are complicit in this, and prescribe\\ndrugs to fix problems because they are also sucked in by the profit motive.\\n\\nI personally challenge this interpretation.\\nOne of the best alternative explanations I've heard from doctors is that they\\nare as frustrated as anyone else, but are unable to effectively prescribe the\\n\\\"alt-health\\\" \\\"unspecific cures\\\" listed above because:\\n\\n1. Patient compliance is low\\n   - People don't want to change their diet\\n   - People don't want to exercise\\n   - People don't want to - or can't - quit their stressful job\\n   - People like hyper-palatable food, alcohol, nicotine, etc.\\n2. Some unspecific cures are hard to study, or the effect size varies\\n   dramatically patient to patient, leading to more time/energy required to\\n   effectively prescribe them (and doctors are overworked/don't have this time)\\n   - For instance, many people tolerate dairy quite well, but I do not.\\n     Most primary care providers do have have time to suss things like this out\\n     for every patient.\\n3. Most \\\"alt-health\\\" specific cures have low or unknown effect sizes, so\\n   prescribing them is a gamble that will probably not pay off and may do harm.\\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\nI highly recommend https://www.redpenreviews.org/ as a good critical review of\\ndifferent health philosophies/strategies.

You read something or get some feedback that inspires you to make a\\n   health-related change in your life.\\n   For example:\\n   - _You read that doing more Zone 2 cardio training than you are doing now\\n     would probably make you healthier._\\n   - _You have a mediocre blood glucose test and decide to eat more fiber._\\n2. Decide (usually quickly) on a strategy to make said change.\\n   For example:\\n   - _\\\"I'm going to go jogging every day for 30 minutes.\\\"_\\n   - _\\\"I'm going to eat a salad for breakfast every day.\\\"_\\n3. Try to execute the strategy and fail.\\n   There are lots of general common reasons for failure:\\n   - No positive effects were noticed.\\n   - The strategy was annoying or boring.\\n   - The strategy was physically uncomfortable/painful.\\n   - The strategy was time consuming.\\n   - The strategy was too daunting to attempt.\\n\\n   For example:\\n   - _\\\"During and after my first 30 minute run my joints hurt a lot.\\\"_\\n   - _\\\"I felt super bloated and low energy after my 2nd day easing breakfast\\n     salads.\\n     And I hate their taste.\\\"_\\n4. **You incorrectly attribute your failure to a lack of willpower or an\\n   immutable character/identity flaw.**  For example:\\n   - _\\\"I'm not cut out for running.\\n     I don't have the will to push through the pain.\\\"_\\n   - _\\\"I can't deal with the discomfort of the salads over my normal breakfast,\\n     which I'm now craving a lot.\\\"_\\n5. You give up, and come away from the whole experience with a negative\\n   impression, thinking thoughts like:\\n   - _\\\"Runners are crazy people who enjoy pain.\\\"_\\n   - _\\\"The salads made me feel worse, not better, and I can't resist my prior\\n     cravings.\\\"_\\n   - _\\\"I'm ashamed I couldn't control myself and stick to my new habits with\\n     willpower.\\\"_\\n   - _\\\"This habit does not fit into my identity - I'm not the kind of person who\\n     can do it.\\\"_\\n   - _\\\"These new habits wouldn't have helped me much anyway.\\\"_\\n6. You start preemptively ignoring/avoiding inspirations to do similar things in\\n   the future, because of the negative impression.\\n\\nThe core pitfall here is step (2) which then causes step (4).\\nIn my experience, failing in step (3) is almost always because I did a bad job\\nin step (2) picking my strategy, **not because a failure in my ability to\\nexecute**.\\n\\nFor me at least, but I expect for everyone, different strategies work way better\\nor worse than others depending on lots of factors, **many impossible to fully\\nunderstand**.\\nI wont try to enumerate them here, and knowing what they are isn't even\\nnecessarily important to proceed.\\n\\nTherefore, it's likely that if instead of reacting as in step (4), going back to\\nstep (2) right away - or spending more time at step (2) in the first place -\\nwould lead to a lower probability of failure in step (3).\\n\\nLuckily, **there are usually many more strategies that it first appears to meet\\na health goal**.\\nThis is great, because it means that failure with one strategy does not mean you\\nare out of options - you can just try something else!\\nEven better, this means you are free to go into step (3) with **extremely low\\nexpectations, even expecting to fail**, since failure is cheap.\\n\\nThe worst thing to do is become dead set on a single strategy you build up as\\nthe only solution in step (2), then try really really hard to make it work in\\nstep (3).\\nThis will lead to a brutal step (4) if the dice don't fall in your favor.\\n\\n### Reframing Approaches to the Same Strategy\\n\\nA related observation: even the same strategies framed differently can have\\ndramatically different success rates.\\nFor instance,\\n\\n - \\\"run for 30 minutes\\\"\\n - \\\"run home from work\\\"\\n - \\\"run around the lake\\\"\\n - \\\"try to beat my speed record for a route\\\"\\n - \\\"run for 30 minutes with a friend\\\"\\n - \\\"run a trail\\\"\\n - \\\"try out some new shoes for 30 minutes\\\"\\n - \\\"try out this new running technique I read a book about and thought was\\n   interesting\\\"\\n - \\\"play a game of soccer with friends\\\"\\n - \\\"play a game of soccer and try hard to win\\\"\\n - \\\"run with my sports team as a part of conditioning training\\\"\\n - \\\"run and track my heart rate / time to watch the numbers go down\\\" All could\\n   lead to the exact same action, but be much more or less doable depending on\\n   the person.\\n\\nI know for me personally some of the stuff on this list sounds terrible, and\\nsome sounds great.\"\n  :name \"health-behavior-change-pitfalls.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 4647\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755322345\n                                 1754518901\n                                 1754518760\n                                 1754513720\n                                 1754508968]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/health-and-longevity/influences.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Influences\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Health And Longevity\\\"}\\n---\\n# Influences\\n\\nThese works have guided by thinking about how to maintain good health for as\\nlong as possible. They are roughly sorted by their level of influence on my\\nthinking.\\n\\n## [The Longevity Diet by Valter Longo](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).\\n\\nGood examination of fasting, as well as an overview of different ways to think\\nabout how to determine which diet is the healthiest long term (Longo's \\\"5\\nPillars\\\"). Provides some compelling theories of aging, with interesting\\nyeast/mice/human results. In this book [Longo advocates for a whole food plant\\nbased diet, interestingly limiting protein\\nintake](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/) (unlike\\nmany other health advocates).\\n\\nSee [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-020-00013-3) for a good\\nsummarized review of Longo's thoughts on fasting.\\n[This overview](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00398-1) gives\\nan even broader look of Longo's nutrition philosophy.\\nFrom that paper, I also found [this\\nstudy](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003889)\\nwhich gives a super cool view into which types of dietary interventions are the\\nmost impactful in terms of life years gained/lost.\\n\\n## [Michael Lustgarten's Diet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOis-MXCwCs\u0026t=1s)\\n\\nMichael Lustgarten is heroically tracking all the food he eats and doing\\nregular blood testing.  [His\\ndiet](https://michaellustgarten.com/2019/11/10/12-16-years-younger-than-my-chronological-age-whats-my-diet/),\\nalthough very personalized, may be a good starting point for a generally\\nhealthy diet.\\n\\n## [Longevity Advice](https://www.longevityadvice.com/)\\n\\nCool blog that does reviews of different longevity topics. I like their style,\\nand their content is generally of good quality.\\n\\n## Kevin Bass\\n\\nExcellent science advocate that fights hard to avoid believing good stories\\nthat are not backed by evidence.  Some of his work that resonates most strongly\\nwith me includes:\\n\\n - [Good measured discussion of the Keto diet (on the Healthcare Unfiltered podcast)](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS91c2Vycy9zb3VuZGNsb3VkOnVzZXJzOjg4NzExODg2OC9zb3VuZHMucnNz/episode/dGFnOnNvdW5kY2xvdWQsMjAxMDp0cmFja3MvMTA3MzUxNDQ1MQ?ep=14).  Does a really good job here discussing keto movement context and how LDL cholesterol is treated by the movement.\\n - [This tweet about how science in unnatural](https://twitter.com/kevinnbass/status/1409061791980793858).\\n\\n## [Microbial Burden by Michael Lustgarten](https://michaellustgarten.com/2016/11/18/microbial-burden-a-major-cause-of-aging-and-age-related-disease/)\\n\\nThis book makes the conjecture that age may be partially (or primarily) because\\nof our bodies waning ability to compete with (or stay in sync with) the\\nmicrobes that colonize us. Not a ton of actionable info, but presents some\\nreally compelling theories!\\n\\n## [Lifespan by David Sinclair](https://lifespanbook.com/)\\n\\nCool review of a new theory of aging that seems promising to be.  Also does some\\ngood review of longevity concepts.  This was my introduction to the field\\n(specifically a Joe Rogan Experience David Sinclair interview).  Be aware that\\nDavid Sinclair is pretty optimistic and eager to promote things that are not\\n100% solid yet (see Resveratrol).\\nA good summary of this book can be found at\\nhttps://hplus.club/blog/a-summary-of-david-sinclairs-information-theory-of-aging/.\\n\\n## [Red Pen Reviews](https://www.redpenreviews.org/)\\n\\nI haven't dug deeply into this website, but my skimming has found that it's a\\npretty good way to determine which books to trust and which not to - a **very**\\nimportant task given the plethora of bad nutrition advice out there.\\n\\n## [In Defense of Food by Michael Pollan](https://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/)\\n\\nI highly recommend this book!  The biggest takeaway I got from it is that our\\ntendency to break down foods and biology in general into atomic\\nnutrients/aspects and pretend that is all they are (for easier study) leads\\noften to bad models of reality.  Biological systems are highly interwoven and\\nthe impact of stuff on them often depends on the greater context.  For example,\\nour body's ability to absorb certain nutrients depends on what those nutrients\\nare dissolved/complexed within.\\n\\n## [Ending Aging by Aubrey de Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ending_Aging)\\n\\nSee [SENS]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/sens.md\\\" \u003e}}).\\n\\n## [The Drive Podcast by Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/podcast/)\\n\\nGood podcast surveying many different longevity-related topics in a long form\\nformat. Episodes vary in quality based on the guests :).\\n\\n## [Found my Fitness Podcast by Rhonda Patrick](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes)\\n\\nProvides a good survey of the longevity space. Does contain a lot of over-hyped\\ncontent (IMO), so episodes vary in quality.\\n\\n## [The Good Gut](https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/press.html)\\n\\nGreat book about microbiome health.  Does a good job revealing what we do know\\nabout the gut and how frighteningly little that is!  Unfortunately, due to how\\nlittle we know about the gut, there isn't a lot of super actionable advice\\nhere, except eating lots of fiber or \\\"Microbiota Accessible Carbohydrates\\\"\\n(\\\"MACS\\\") as they're referred to in the book.\\n\\n## [Hormesis: A Revolution in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine by Mark Mattson\\net. al.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-60761-495-1)\\n\\nCollection of research on the concept of hormesis, or the idea that\\ntoxins/stressors are actually beneficial in low quantities, and become toxic\\npast a certain threshold. Really dense scientific paper collection that I\\nhaven't fully digested. I think the core idea is really interesting though!\\n\\n## [The Blue Zones Solution](https://www.bluezones.com/2015/04/the-blue-zones-solution-secrets-of-the-worlds-healthiest-people-9-questions-for-dan-buettner/)\\n\\nThe \\\"Blue Zones\\\" organization seeks to identify \\\"blue zones\\\" around the world\\nwith above average longevity and try to learn from the habits of the people in\\nthese zones. The overall recommendation is a standard \\\"whole foods, plant\\nbased\\\" diet.  Interestingly, the \\\"blue zones\\\" philosophy addresses more things\\noutside of diet (like a social community) that it recommends be holistically\\nadopted with its diet recommendations.\\n\\n## [Michael Pietroforte on hplus.club](https://hplus.club/blog/author/michael-pietroforte/)\\n\\nThis guy writes pretty good high level aging overviews, and book reviews.\\n\\n## [The Queen of Fats by Susan Allport](http://www.susanallport.com/)\\n\\nReally interesting read about the science of omega-3 fatty acids.  One of the\\ncore thesis is that our western diet has a higher-than-historical ratio of\\nomega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, which causes problems.  This is because the\\nbody can use these fats for the same purposes, but they have different\\nperformances for those purposes.  For example,\\n[prostaglandins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin) can be made with\\nomega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, but the omega-3 variants are less \\\"strong\\\" and\\nmay contribute less to heart disease.\\n\\nDoes a really excellent job of telling the story of the scientists who\\nstudy/studied these fats, instead of just passing down diet rules without\\ncontext.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_ratio_in_food has some data about\\nomega-3/omega-6 ratios.\\n\\n## [How Not to Die by Michael Gregor](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/)\\n\\nThis book is a good survey of diet from the \\\"Whole Food Plant Based\\\"\\nperspective.  Sometimes I think the author gets a bit over-zealous about how\\nhis philosophy is the best and makes lazy, broad, strong statements that are\\nnot adequately supported.  For instance, dismissing certain foods (like meat)\\nas obviously unhealthy without examining the counterpoints.\\n\\nThe author's web site [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) is a\\ndecent source of information, though it suffers from the same problems as the\\nbook.\\n\\n## [Genius Foods by Max Lugavere](https://www.maxlugavere.com/book)\\n\\nThis book takes a more brain focused approach to diet, which pushes it more\\ninto the keto- space.  AFAIK, ketogenic diets are more linked to brain health\\nthan other diets.  I think it falls into the same trap as Michael Gregor, but\\nnot quite as badly.  It's a good intro to lots of cool food/health topics to\\nexplore more independently.  \\n\\n## [Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)\\n\\nThis book provides some insight into the mechanisms of sleep, and advocates\\nthat people should generally spend more time sleeping (or give sleep more value\\nthat they currently do).  See an interesting discussion at\\nhttps://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/.\\n\\n\\n## Biohack Stack\\n\\nGood place for ideas to experiment with.  Good example of an interesting profile:\\nhttps://biohackstack.com/posts/michael-lustgarten/.\\n\\n## [Aging.ai](http://aging.ai/)\\n\\nA cool system for quantifying biological age.

Then the app uses your movements to wake you up during a\\nlighter sleep phase.  I've found this to be **way** more pleasant than waking\\nup at a fixed time.  In fact, I've found that I more naturally wake up by\\nmyself in the morning right before the alarm goes off, as if my body\\nassociates it with lighter sleep.\\n\\nThis app also tracks my sleep, which is kinda useful sometimes.\\n\\n## Causes of Bad Sleep\\n\\n### Racing Mind\\n\\nAnything that causes me to be constantly thinking about something will usually\\ninterrupt my sleep.  This includes:\\n\\n - Trying to make sure I remember something that I need to do tomorrow.  See\\n   [Task Tracking]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/task-tracking.md\\\"\u003e}})\\n   for an excellent solution to this problem.\\n - Worrying about an event or something that I need to wake up for (like a\\n   flight).\\n - Worrying about a personal conflict or argument, or any kind of unresolved\\n   tension between me and someone else. \\n - Trying to sleep right after doing an activity I was really engaged in, like\\n   playing a game. This will happen if my mind is continuing to ponder the\\n   decisions I was making in the activity, or if it's re-remembering parts of\\n   the activity (and e.g. how I could have done them better).\\n\\nWriting the thing I am worrying down can help a lot to alleviate this issue.\\nThis makes me feel like I don't need to keep the thoughts in my mind to remember\\nthem.\\n\\n### Food\\n\\nEating more that ~1/3 of my daily calories, especially from high protein foods\\nlike nuts/nut butters, in the 5-6 hours before sleeping will often lead to me\\ngetting overheated and sweaty after being asleep for a couple hours.\\nThis is especially true if it's otherwise cold in the room where I'm sleeping\\nand I need to tuck myself in more tightly to my blankets.\\nEating protein at other parts of the day helps with this.\\n\\nEating bread or grains generally 2-3 hours before bed seems to help me sleep\\nbetter.\\n\\nCaffeine definitely does not help me sleep :).\\n\\n### Dirty Sheets\\n\\nClean sheets, or specifically sheets that I haven't sweated in before make it\\nmuch less likely that I will sweat when sleeping (all else being equal), which\\nin turn will make me sleep better.\\n\\n### Temperature and Airflow\\n\\n#### Skin Stimulation\\n\\nFor me I find that keeping my skin calm makes a big difference to my\\nsleep quality.  For me, this means keeping myself a proper temperature and\\nkeeping myself protected from breezes and other forces that can tickle or\\notherwise stimulate my skin.\\n\\nIn practice, I best accomplish this by:\\n\\n1. Wearing socks or lower-leg warmers to sleep so that my feet don't get\\n   uncomfortably cold.  See [this cool paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843861/) about hands/feet and temperature regulation.   \\n1. Wearing boxers.\\n1. Wrapping myself with flannel or otherwise \\\"warm-feeling\\\" sheets to that my\\n   skin is constantly in contact with something constant and not exposed to\\n   fluctuations in air temperature or movement.\\n\\n#### Cold\\n\\nOne common pattern I fall into that leads to poor sleep is being too cold when\\ngoing to sleep. This leads me to tightly hug my arms close to my self and tuck\\nmy sheets up to my neck (holding onto them with my hands). While this is\\ncomfortable when going to sleep, I find that it leads me to overheat once I\\nactually do fall asleep. This leads to me getting sweaty, and then cold and\\nuncomfortable.  I feel a similar effect when using sleeping bags or wearing\\na shirt when going to bed.\\n\\nI think the best way to manage this problem is actually to warm myself up **before** getting into bed.  When I don't do this I find getting warm while in bed (even with a heated mattress) takes a long time and may not fully happen before I fall asleep, leading to the bundling problem.\\n\\nDue to this pattern, I find that it's paradoxically better for me to use more\\nblankets and/or a heated mattress pad and fall asleep in a more relaxed posture\\nwith looser sheets/more airflow. This is less likely to cause the overheating -\u003e\\nsweaty -\u003e cold/uncomfortable issue.\\n\\nIn addition to making me bundle myself too tightly when going to sleep, being\\ncold also just generally stimulates my mind/body, which hinders my ability to\\nfall asleep.\\n\\nI've found a good way to manage cold is to use a heated mattress pad or heated\\nblanket to pre-warm my bed, which helps me feel relaxed and warm as I get into\\nbed.  Then, right before going to sleep, I turn off the heat and make sure I\\nhave enough warm blankets around in case I do end up cooling down. This is less effective than just getting warm before going to bed though.\\n\\n#### Showering\\n\\nTaking a shower generally gives me temperature sensitive skin that makes it\\nhard to find a good equilibrium when falling asleep, making it more likely that\\nI'll get too cold or overheat later in the night.\\n\\nGoing to sleep with wet hair from a shower also can exacerbate temperature\\nissues. At the very least it make my pillow wet, which is annoying.\\n\\nI find that showering ~2 hours before sleeping makes these non-issues.\\n\\n### Snoring\\n\\nNot I problem I currently have, luckily.\\n\\n[Seems to correlate with increased adiposity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11122588/)\\n\\n\\n## Interesting Trends\\n\\nSeveral behaviors seem to correlate with dream presence and intensity for me in\\na dose-dependent way:\\n\\n - Playing video games in the evening, especially role-playing type games.\\n - Having eaten a lot of food during the day/evening.\\n\\nTODO: Put some actual raw data here.\\n\\n\\n## Sleep Resources\\n\\n - Interesting take on the effects sleep has on your physiology:\\n   https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/\"\n  :name \"sleep.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"\n                \"Important\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/task-tracking.md\"]\n  :size 6067\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755322345\n                                 1740862760\n                                 1675883847\n                                 1673301100\n                                 1672420121\n                                 1671234343\n                                 1671215957\n                                 1664948442\n                                 1659113492\n                                 1655691154\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1654961898\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1650215624\n                                 1644872453\n                                 1635187875\n                                 1625939328]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/health-and-longevity/theories-of-aging.md\"\n  :backlinks #{\"content/docs/health-and-longevity/aging-science.md\"}\n  :title \"Theories Of Aging\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: #{\\\"content/docs/health-and-longevity/aging-science.md\\\"}\\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Aging\\\" \\\"Health And Longevity\\\"}\\n---\\n# Theories of Aging\\n\\n## Information Theory of Aging\\n\\nOver time, small defects in our epigenome build up as proteins constantly fix\\nDNA damage.

I think it would have been much harder for me to adhere to the diet if I\\ndid not do this.  Here is what I ate:\\n\\n![DIY-FMD-1](/docs/health-and-longevity/DIY-FMD-1.png)\\n![DIY-FMD-2](/docs/health-and-longevity/DIY-FMD-2.png)\\n\\nIf my memory serves me well, I remember feeling quite good during my fast,\\nwhich some minor headaches on day 2-3.  I did this during my vacation from\\nwork, and I don't remember working intensely on any particular project during\\nthis time, so I wouldn't consider this a \\\"stress test\\\" of the diet.\\n\\n\\n### Water Only Fast - December 2020\\n\\nFurther exposure to fasting proponents, especially Peter Attia (via e.g. [his\\npodcast with Eileen White](https://peterattiamd.com/eileenwhite/), made me\\nthink about the simpler prospect of doing a water only fast.  I finally\\nattempted this during a work week in December 2020.  My schedule looked like:\\n\\n - Tuesday:\\n   - Large Spinach, Tomato, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Italian Seasoning Salad for lunch\\n   - Some walnuts for dinner\\n - Wednesday:\\n   - Only water\\n - Thursday:\\n   - 4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate (in water) +\\n     steak seasoning\\n - Friday:\\n   - 4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate + potassium\\n     containing spice mix\\n\\nHere are the stock ingredients I used:\\n\\n![stock-front](/docs/health-and-longevity/stock-front.jpg)\\n![stock-back](/docs/health-and-longevity/stock-back.jpg)\\n\\nI felt surprisingly normal during my fast.  Especially when exercising - I went\\non my normal ~3 mile run on Thursday with 25 * 2 sets of push ups and 10 * 3\\nsets of pull ups interspersed and felt actually **better** than I normally do.\\nPerhaps this was because of the water/glycogen weight I lost at the start of\\nthe fast (~5 lbs, 190lbs -\u003e 185lbs).\\n\\nThere were times when I felt a bit lightheaded also during the fast, but never\\ntoo seriously.  This may have been a bit psychological, since I knew I was\\nfasting.\\n\\nOne thing I also noticed was it was even harder than normal for me to keep warm\\nin my ~65F apartment, especially when sleeping.  The Wed-Thurs night I did not\\nsleep very well because of this.  Any kind of draft under the blankets was very\\nnoticeable and interrupted my sleep.  I wearing light sweatpants and a shirt\\nthe next night helped a lot (usually I sleep close to naked).  On the whole, I\\nwould say my sleep was worse during the fast than normal.\\n\\nI did notice some tingling in my arms/legs, especially when putting a acute\\nforce on them.  For instance, when doing push-ups, my hands would start\\ntingling.  And when putting my ankle on my knee when sitting, it would tingle\\nstrongly.  Apparently, [this is\\nexpected](https://www.theartofketo.com/tag/tingling-while-fasting/).  This was\\nreduced when I starting drinking broth.\\n\\nOne thing that I also definitely noticed during my fast was a shift in my\\nbrain activity.  I felt much more \\\"on\\\" than usual - I had a consistant motivation\\nto be busy in one way or another.  However, I also felt a bit more impatient.\\nIf a task I was busy doing started to stall, I would eagerly try to shift to\\nanother task, or even multitask.  This was good for getting lots done, but not\\nas helpful for cracking a difficult problem (e.g. debugging a computer program)\\nI could use this feature of fasting in the future if I need to be particularly\\nproductive in this way.\\n\\n### Water Only Fast - June 2022\\n\\nI collected some data during this fast which can be seen at\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gp4n59h3I0r1DnM8NQq4ISGtDY9ameoDuqInhsv2WYI/edit#gid=0.\"\n  :name \"fasting.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"\n                \"Food\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 6032\n  :modtime 1757654748\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755995343\n                                 1755974875]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"\n                     \"Food\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/health-and-longevity/food/food.md\"\n  :backlinks #{\"content/docs/me/manifesto.md\"}\n  :title \"Food\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: #{\\\"content/docs/me/manifesto.md\\\"}\\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Health And Longevity\\\" \\\"Food\\\"}\\n---\\n# Food\\n\\n## Goals\\n\\n1. Delay chronic diseases as long as possible.  Described well in [this talk by\\n   Peter Attia](https://vimeo.com/228845024).  The\\n   [big ones](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) are:\\n   1. Cardiovascular disease.\\n   1. Cancer.\\n   1. Neurodegenerative disease.\\n   1. Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome.\\n1. Maintain sustained energy levels as much as possible, avoiding:\\n   1. Periods of low motivation.\\n   1. \\\"Food coma-ing\\\".\\n   1. \\\"Snack train-ing\\\", or continuous distraction by a desire to eat more.\\n\\n## Current Eating Habits and Opinions (3/2022)\\n\\nNOTE that these habits are obselete, up to date ones can be found [here]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/personal-food-habits.md\\\" \u003e}})!\\n\\n### Food Timing\\n\\nI try to eat a breakfast after I wake up - around 9am, since I wake up around\\n8:30am.  Then I tend not to eat lunch, and instead eat my second (and last)\\nmeal of the day at around 5 or 6pm.\\n\\nI converged on this strategy via the observation that eating food when I am not\\nhungry (too quickly after my last meal) really kills my energy levels. With\\nthis strategy, I can eat two large meals and avoid this problem, maximizing the\\namount of time I can stay capable of doing whatever I want during the day.\\n\\nWith this strategy (and any food timing strategy IMO) it's important for me to\\nsuppress suggestions from my mind to combat momentary ebbs in energy with a\\nsnack. This pretty much never works for me, always making me more tired then\\nbefore I ate the snack. Green tea is a good placeholder to have instead. Or\\neven better, an engaging activity that captures my attention.\\n\\nThis strategy also has the danger of going on a snack train when having my\\nsecond meal. If I eat too much in the evening, it leads to much poorer sleep\\nfor me (possibly because the energy in the food is released as heat and\\nexcitement when I am sleeping). I don't have a great consistent way to avoid\\nthis problem yet, besides my willpower (which is not consistent :/). Some\\ntricks that kinda work are:\\n\\n - Lining up an engaging activity to do right after I eat, so I don't just\\n   default to snacking more.\\n - Drinking tea or broth after eating as a replacement behavior.\\n\\n### [Fasting]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/fasting.md\\\" \u003e}}).\\n\\nI haven't done a long fast in a while, but am experimenting with fasting one\\nday a week (Saturday) and still want to do a long fast 3x per year.  \\n\\n### Diet Composition\\n\\nI'm playing with using [this eatthismuch meal\\nplan](https://www.eatthismuch.com/dietset/196607506/) as a general description\\nof what my food intake looks like. I should probably eat less fat to adhere to\\n[Valter Longo's\\nrecommendations](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).\\n\\n#### Confidence Levels\\n\\nBecause it is hard (for me at least) to get good, immediate feedback from my\\nbody about which foods are the \\\"healthiest\\\" for me in the long term, I instead\\nhave to rely on information from other people to figure out what food I should\\neat. I'm [working to combat this]({{\u003c relref\\n\\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/biomarker-correlator.md\\\" \u003e}}) but realistically\\nwill need to continue to do this for a while. Unfortunately, there are many\\nopinions out there about what food is healthy, and trusting one necessarily\\nmeans discounting others, which might be right. Here I try to be honest with\\nmyself about where my personal opinions come from so that I can more\\neffectively identify and correct them.\\n\\n - 📺 = I've been exposed to a lot of random media supporting this opinion, but\\n   don't really understand the details.\\n - 📈 = This is an interesting statistical trend, but correlation != causation.\\n - 💡 = This is a plausible idea, but I haven't found evidence that it has\\n   health effects in humans. In other words, it's [a nice conjecture, but\\n   requires more criticism]({{\u003c relref\\n   \\\"/docs/understanding-the-world/influences.md#the-beginning-of-infinity-by-david-deutschhttpsenwikipediaorgwikithe_beginning_of_infinity\\\"\\n   \u003e}}).\\n - 📚 = This is the best explanation I know of, and has withstood a good amount\\n   of criticism, although of course it might still be wrong.\\n - 🧠 = This is a personal observation I've made about myself.\\n\\nTODO move these emojis to a more central location so I can use them in other\\nwritings.\\n\\n#### Meat (non-fish)\\n\\nI try to avoid eating meat. There are a bunch of weak reasons for this:\\n\\n1. I perceive the supply chain that produces meat as being messy and\\n   suffering-causing 📺. Another way to phrase this is: I don't think I would\\n   want to run my own personal meat-producing supply chain even if it was\\n   low-effort.\\n1. Meat consumption using our current supply chain is energy/space/time\\n   inefficient compared to other food sources 📚. I don't think this is a\\n   problem that we should rely on individual choices to solve (like other\\n   climate change related problems), so it's a pretty weak reason for an\\n   individual to not eat meat IMO. Larger systemic changes like taxes on meat\\n   seem to me like the more effective way to take action on this information.\\n1. Meat consumption seems be to [weakly associated with\\n   cancer](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat)\\n   📈 and other common causes of death. This may be because of the proteins in\\n   meat causing up-regulation of growth factors like IGF-1, which may\\n   accelerate aging 💡.\\n1. The \\\"blue zone\\\" communities around the world with high health- and\\n   life-spans [eat little\\n   meat](https://www.bluezones.com/recipes/food-guidelines/) 📈.\\n\\n#### Protein\\n\\nIt seems like [low protein consumption (especially animal protein) might slow\\naging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807119/). See [this\\ncomprehensive macronutrient mouse\\nstudy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087279/). See also this\\nreview: [The impact of dietary protein intake on longevity and metabolic\\nhealth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562018/).\\n\\nNote that it seems like this is NOT true for people over the age of 65. At this\\npoint, loss of muscle becomes a dangerous problems (leading to falls, etc.), so\\nthe benefits of eating more protein to maintain muscle mass seem to outweigh\\nthe downsides.\\n\\n#### Fish\\n\\nI eat fish and other seafood, but rarely (I don't cook it myself).\\n\\n#### Eggs\\n\\nI eat ~4 eggs a day ~4 times per week.\\n\\n#### Dairy\\n\\nI eat a small amount of yogurt and cheese. I try to avoid all other dairy\\nproducts as best I can. My throat is irritated when I drink plain milk and\\nexcessive consumption of any dairy product upsets my digestion, so I think I am\\nsomewhat personally intolerant of at least dairy from cows 🧠.\\n\\n#### Whole Foods\\n\\nThis includes any food that has not had components stripped from it at a small\\nscale. For instance, I would consider a berry a whole food even though it was\\nseparated from the plant at the macro scale. But jam would not be a whole food\\nbecause it involves removing some fiber and other unknown stuff from the berry\\nand adding parts of other plants (sugars) that were themselves removed from\\ntheir whole plant part.\\n\\nI like the story I've heard about whole foods 📺. At the very least, it seems\\nlike we evolved to eat whole foods, so the floor for how bad they can be for us\\nis fairly high and well known. Note that this theory does **not** say\\n**anything** suggesting that whole food are the best diet, just that they\\naren't that bad.\\n\\nIt also seems well supported and not controversial that eating whole foods\\nhelps delay the onset of the most common causes of death (cardiovascular\\ndisease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease) 📚. \\n\\n#### Organic?\\n\\nI haven't found strong evidence that organic food is healthier than non\\norganic. But it could be that the right studies just haven't been done yet or I\\nhaven't seen them. Here is an interesting review:\\n\\n - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658984/\\n\\nI buy mostly non organic food because it is cheaper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## What should I eat and when? (2021)\\n\\nThe most convincing diet structure I've found has been [The Longevity Diet by\\nValter Longo](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).\\nThis diet is mostly vegan, with fish 2-3 times per week, keeping [protein intake\\nlow](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988204/).  [This\\npodcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL21hcmtiZWxsc3Bvd2VycHJvamVjdC5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw/episode/MWZmYTNmZDQtNzFjYS00ZjFhLTg4M2YtMjJlZjNhNWFkZjRj?hl=en\u0026ved=2ahUKEwj-nLjVwKfwAhVzCjQIHY2XA70QjrkEegQICBAF\u0026ep=6) has\\na compelling dissent of Longo's thoughts here; basically it states that Longo's\\nideas makes sense, but so do many other ideas and we know now that insufficient\\nprotein can be unhealthy (I need to dig more into this) - the evidence to lower\\nintake in spite of this is not strong enough yet.  Note that personalizing\\nprotein intake levels while optimizing longevity seems to be possible by\\n[measuring Blood Urea Nitrogen levels as described by Michael\\nLustgarten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u654YTubFRM).\\n\\nCool paper about food group epidemiology:\\nhttps://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/6/1462/4569801.\\n\\nThere are a couple of amendments I've made based on my personal experience (in\\nservice of goal 2 above).  These include:\\n\\n 1. Not eating breakfast.  I find myself most productive in a fasted state\\n    (even a [prolonged fast](/docs/eating/fasting.md), and eating breakfast breaks be\\n    right out of this in what otherwise would be a very productive time.  \\n      - This is counter to Longo's suggestions, some other research on\\n        circadian rhythms by [Sachin\\n        Panda](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730419892105), and the [American\\n        Heart\\n        Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476).\\n        The arguments here often revolve around weight loss (which I don't have\\n        a problem with yet), and don't seem too strong to me.\\n      - This does help keep a shorter eating window on my day which\\n        is widely recommended:\\n          - [Sachin Panda](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.11.004)\\n 1. Trying to eat grains and/or starchy foods later in the day.  These foods\\n    uniquely mess with my energy levels.  I'm eager to get some Continuous\\n    Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to see if I can quantitate this.  \\n\\nSome interesting thoughts on meal timing for energy levels can be found at\\nhttps://www.workingagainstgravity.com/guides/nutrition-guide/meal-timing.\\n\\nOther tenants I try to live by:\\n\\n1. Eating whole foods as much as possible.\\n\\n### My 2021 Food Strategy\\n\\n#### Things I try to avoid\\n\\n - Dairy\\n - Meat\\n - Refined carbs (e.g. flour containing foods)\\n    - [Danger of Fast Carbs](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/carbs-are-killing-us/609040/)\\n - Sugars/Syrups\\n\\n\\nIn practice I may have small amounts (\u003c1 \\\"serving\\\") of these things about once\\na week.\\n\\nNote also that avoiding animals products is partially for health reasons\\n(avoiding cancer primarily), but also partially because the animal food\\nindustry is not easy for me to support.\\n\\n\\n#### Things I try to moderate\\n\\n - Eating more than 1/2 cup of (dry volume) beans or grains at once. A large amount of\\n   my calories come from these foods - I've just noticed that eating a lot in one\\n   sitting saps my energy, I assume because they take work to digest.\\n\\n### One Meal A Day (OMAD)\\n\\nI tried this for a while, and I found myself falling into the recurring pattern\\nof overeating because \\\"this is all the food I'll eat today\\\". This is especially\\nbad with lots of low-calorie-density, high-fiber foods (which I want to eat no\\nmatter what). The overeating would make me feel unfocused and uncomfortable for\\n4+ hours, which is not worth it for me.\\n\\nRecently, I've found that a better thought pattern for me is to say \\\"I'll eat\\nthat later\\\" when I get a craving for something right after a meal. This avoids\\na state of overeating, and I may later end up not craving that thing, which\\nmeans I'll eat less overall that day (which is generally good).\\n\\n## Hunger, and Physical States of Being\\n\\nOne thing I've noticed is that my body can be in different \\\"states\\\" that affect\\nmy hunger levels. Some examples:\\n\\n**Induces Hunger**:\\n\\n - Sitting around for a while (not moving).\\n - Being bored, or not knowing what to do with myself.\\n - Eating some food (e.g. a snack sized meal). The effect is more powerful when\\n   I eat something, then am presented with something of a different flavor\\n   profile.\\n - Overeating will sometimes make me hungry/snack-y for the rest of the day (or\\n   an extended period of time). I think this is partially because feeling\\n   overfull makes me less motivated to do stuff, and so I get bored.\\n - Working on something that isn't going well. Generally stress. Food is a good\\n   procrastination tool.\\n\\n**Suppresses Hunger**:\\n\\n - Exercising\\n - Being busy\\n - Social interaction\\n - Taking a shower\\n\\nOne theory I have is that my body gets hungry when it notices that (1) there is\\nfood around and (2) I have time/space to digest after I eat (I wont need to\\nimmediately do something that requires lots of energy).\\n\\nSome habits that take advantage of this concept include:\\n\\n - Distracting myself with busywork when I feed hungry but don't (consciously)\\n   want to eat.\\n - Eating one meal a day, so that I don't have a \\\"snack-train\\\" problem of\\n   having future meals induce hunger.\\n\\n### \\\"Snack Train\\\"-ing\\n\\nOne pattern I've noticed in myself that eating food will put me in a\\nlower-focus mood for 1-4 hours depending on how much and what I ate. If I try\\nto do something that requires focus in this mood, my body will resist me and\\noften want to eat more food instead as an alternative activity. Unfortunately,\\neating more food will just perpetuate the cycle; in fact it will become even\\nharder to focus as more of my energy needs to go to digestion.\\n\\nThe key here is to break the cycle by somehow riding through the low energy\\nmood without pushing myself so much that I want to eat. Sometimes this is\\nreally hard, because doing things that require focus is fulfilling :(. \\n\\nI'm basically just writing this as a reminder to myself to push through when\\nI'm in this mood for the sake of my future self!\\n\\n\\n## Measuring Personal Dietary Effects\\n\\nIdeally, I would measure the effects of different foods on my personal health\\ndirectly so that I know what works for me (as opposed to what should work\\ngenerally).  This takes work unfortunately.  Here are some options that I\\nshould probably explore at some point:\\n\\n - [Viome microbiome testing](https://www.viome.com/products/gut-intelligence)\\n - [Regular blood testing w/Morgan Levine's biological age\\n   calculation](https://biohackstack.com/posts/levines-phenotypic-age/).  See\\n   also [Aging.ai](http://aging.ai/).\\n\\n\\n## What fats to eat?\\n\\nProbably mostly mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (not saturated fatty\\nacids).\\n\\n - https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.040331\\n - https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038908\\n\\n\\n## Protein\\n\\nCool table of calories per gram of protein:\\nhttps://www.healthyalyona.com/nutrition/plant-based-protein-lowest-calories/\\n\\n\\n## Specific Food Notes\\n\\n### Sodium\\n\\nToo much bad.  See [this Kevin Bass video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPRRRQdLUlk) for a\\nreview of studies that show it's beneficial to use part potassium chloride in your salt source.\\n\\n### Processed Meat\\n\\n[Carcinogenic according to the\\nWHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat).\\n[They](https://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about) estimate that 34k cancer deaths\\nworldwide can be attributed to processed meat, compared to 1mil to smoking,\\n600k to drinking alcohol, and 200k to air pollution.\\n\\n### Advanced Glycation End Products\\n\\nCreated by high heat cooking of especially protein-rich foods (e.g. meat/nuts).\\nBut all foods contain.  Ideal to reduce the amount of this eaten.\\n\\n - [Michael Lustgarten evidence\\n   video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gKFWBTpXWE)\\n - Great overview/reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704564/\\n\\nIt would be cool to measure this in blood.  Perhaps a1c inflammation test is a\\ngood proxy.\\n\\nThese are also formed endogenously when sugars react with proteins/fats\\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product). This may be one\\nof the reasons why sugar is bad for you.\\n\\n### Flax Seeds\\n\\nIt seems like baking flax seeds will not degrade omega-3 content ([biased\\nsource](https://www.goldenvalleyflax.com/flax-facts/health-research-articles/flaxseed-storage-baking-stability/)).\\n\\n### Nutritional Yeast\\n\\nContains MSG ([probably not\\nharmful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952072/)) and uric acid\\n([probably harmful in large quantity](https://peterattiamd.com/rickjohnson/))\\n([source](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nutritional-yeast/)).

The way it\\nworks is you take two foods that go well together (e.g. banana and peanut\\nbutter) and you add a third food that goes well with one of the foods but would\\nbe weird to combine with the other (e.g. spinach in this case).  More often\\nthan not, the result is actually pretty good!\\n\\n## Bread Machine\\n\\n### Black Bean Bread\\n\\n - 1  cup  water\\n - 3/4  cup  beans\\n - black, , dry, cooked, drained  \\n - 1 1/2  tablespoons  applesauce\\n - 1 1/2  tablespoons  honey\\n - ¾  teaspoon  salt\\n - 1 1/2  cups  whole-wheat flour\\n - 1 1/2  cups  bread flour\\n - 1 1/2  teaspoons  yeast, active dry\\n\\n Use whole wheat cycle on 1.5 lb loaf.\\n\\n\\n## Microwave Breads\\n\\nVery flexible recipe, an example base:\\n\\n - One part unflavored pea protein powder\\n - One part rolled oats\\n - One part whole wheat flour\\n\\nAdd enough water to make a runny dough.  Microwave for ~10 minutes.\\n\\nThis recipe is pretty bland: I recommend adding more stuff for flavor, like:\\n\\n - Poppy seeds\\n - Lemon Juice\\n - Banana\\n - Frozen Berries\\n - Cocoa powder\\n - Egg\\n\\n## Microwave Steam Bowls\\n\\nA really easy and convenient way to make some pretty tasty (and healthy!) food.\\nThe basic premise is that you add your vegetables with a splash of water to a\\nbowl, cover it with a plate, and microwave for 5-8 minutes. Then you add extra\\nflavors and enjoy! It's easy to get creative with the cooking technique, but\\nhere are some examples:\\n\\n### Carrots/Onions\\n\\nChop carrots and onions, add water and cook, finish with almond butter and\\nsalt.  Add chia seeds optionally to soak up the water!\\n\\n### Thai Carrots/Onions\\n\\nSame recipe as before, but instead of almond butter, use natural (e.g. Adams)\\npeanut butter with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and optionally lime juice.\\n\\n### Honey Walnut Shrimp Inspired\\n\\nChop cabbage, add water and cook with brown rice, finish with walnuts and\\nmayonnaise. \\n\\n## Potatoes\\n\\nPoke some holes in them, and just throw them into the microwave whole for 5-8\\nminutes depending on size.\\n\\n## Oats\\n\\n - 1 cup rolled oats\\n - 2 cups water\\n - 1/4 tsp salt\\n\\nMicrowave for 3 mins.\\n\\nTo make overnight oats, use the same ratios, but just leave the oats in the\\nfridge overnight instead of cooking. I highly recommend addng chia seeds and/or\\ncoconut and/or some other kind of nut + some fruit when making overnight oats.\\nYogurt is also good.\\n\\nSome good toppings:\\n\\n - Coffee (could even cook in coffee instead of water).\\n - Chia seeds (~1-2 tbsp per cup dry oats)\\n - Nutmeg\\n - Cinnamon\\n\\n## Roasted Vegetables\\n\\nAll at 425F.\\n\\nVegetable      | Size     | Time (mins)\\n---------      | -------- | -----------\\nPotato         | 1/2 in   | 40 - 50\\nZucchini       | 1/2 in   | 20\\nBroccoli       | floret   | 20\\nBrussel Sprout | halved   | 20\\nTomato (roma)  | sliced   | 15\\n\\nSee also [this\\nchart](https://www.myfrugalhome.com/vegetable-roasting-times-chart/).\\n\\nAdd thyme, rosemary, salt, garlic for extra flavor!  Add olive oil after or\\nbefore.\\n\\n## Soup\\n\\nSaute (cook) onions, carrots, and/or celery for ~5 minutes in a soup pot with\\nsome olive oil.  Add garlic and cook for ~1 more minute.\\n\\nNext, add a bunch of either stock or water with stock concentrate (e.g. \\\"Better\\nThan Bullion\\\") and add chopped ingredients to boil based on this time table:\\n\\nIngredient      | Time (mins)\\n---------       | -----------\\nBeans           | 90-120 + presoaking overnight\\nGreens          | 3-5\\nGreen beans     | 3\\nLentils         | 25\\nPotatoes        | 20\\nBarley          | 50\\nPasta           | 8-12\\nBrown Rice      | 45\\nWhite Rice      | 15\\n\\nThis table is also accurate for just boiling anything - not necessarily as a\\npart of a soup.\\n\\n## Grains and Beans\\n\\nI have an instant pot and use it to cook grains and beans more quickly.\\n\\nIngredient      | Time (mins)\\n---------       | -----------\\nChickpeas       | 28\\n\\nUse 1 tbsp salt to 1 lb dry beans.\\nSoak dry beans overnight if possible.\\nIf not, soak as long as you can and add 5-10 mins to the cooking time.\\n\\n## Popcorn\\n\\n - 1/4 - 1/2 cup kernels in a pan with some oil\\n\\nCook on high and shake frequently (every 10 secs).\\n\\nGood Toppings:\\n\\n - Nutritional Yeast\\n - Cavenders Greek Seasoning\\n - Olive oil\\n\\n\\n## Ingredients\\n\\n### Flax Peanut Butter\\n\\nMixing ground flaxseed and natural peanut butter in around a 1:1 ratio makes a\\ngreat nut butter!  You'll need to add some water to make it a paste (and not\\njust powdery).  \\n\\nThis recipe has a good omega-3/6 ratio too.  Per 100g, peanut butter has 9.7g\\nomega-6 and 0.3g omega-3 fatty acids.  Per 100g, flax seeds have 5.9g omega-6\\nand 22.8g omega-3 fatty acids.  So combined, we have 23.1g omega3 and 15.6g\\nomega-6, a **~1.5 ratio**!

To me, a list\\nprice is just a large number that has little or any meaning to the impact\\nbuying that house will have on my finances.  To confidently judge whether a\\nhouse I'm interested in buying is actually a good deal, I made the spreadsheet\\ndescribed here. **The primary goal of the spreadsheet is to translate details\\nabout the house (e.g. it's price) into an expected percentage return that can\\nbe directly compared to other investments.**\\n\\nHere is the spreadsheet:\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11GTEiYBGF1NXaob9DczvUcQyloDVQ-dJfALDsg-L4-U/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\nOn the left side of the spreadsheet are a bunch of blue fields where details\\nabout the house should be filled in.  On the right are shown the results, in\\ngory detail.\\n\\nNote that I was looking for live-in multi-plex properties, so the spreadsheet\\nhas features to judge the effect of rent on the ultimate return.\\n\\n**If you have any questions or** ***especially*** **if you notice errors in the\\nspreadsheet, please comment on it to let me know.**\\n\\n## Input Field Descriptions\\n\\n### House Details\\n\\n - **Property Price**: \u003cbr/\u003e The price you will be able to buy the property at.\\n - **Property Growth Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e One of the most impactful, yet hardest to\\n   estimate parameters. Some useful estimates can be found on Redfin ([rawer\\n   data](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/),\\n   [summarized](https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market)), but you can't\\n   always use the past to predict the future! I just set a really conservative\\n   value here and pray.\\n - **Property Land Value**: \u003cbr/\u003e The value of the land the property sits on.\\n   This is used to calculate depreciation (since land doesn't depreciate, only\\n   man made structures do). In you live in the Seattle area, you can find this\\n   information by searching for the property on\\n   https://gismaps.kingcounty.gov/parcelviewer2/.\\n - **Property Tax Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e Can also be found on a local parcel viewer\\n   resource, or even on listings.  Taxes collected on properties are public\\n   record in the US. Using prior year taxes is usually a good way to estimate\\n   this; I found that the tax appraisals for properties can value them very\\n   differently than the market does, so multiplying the list price by the tax\\n   rate to calculate this is not recommended.\\n - **Depreciation Period**: \u003cbr/\u003e The time after which you can assume (for tax\\n   purposes) that your property will completely turn to worthless dust. This\\n   only applies if you are using part of your property for business purposes\\n   (renting it).\\n - **Income Tax Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e The rate at which any rental income will be\\n   taxed.  Note that I am assuming your income tax rate doesn't change over the\\n   course of owning the property. Since income taxes on rent are essentially\\n   deferred due to depreciation and then depreciation recapture on sale, your\\n   return will be better if your income tax rate is lower when you sell the\\n   property.\\n - **Depreciation Recapture Tax Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e The rate at which depreciation\\n   recapture income will be taxed.  This is your ordinary income tax rate when\\n   you sell the property [OR\\n   25%](https://www.millionacres.com/taxes/depreciation/understanding-depreciation-recapture-when-you-sell-rental-property/#:~:text=That's%20what%20depreciation%20recapture%20does,4797%2C%20Sales%20of%20Business%20Property.),\\n   whichever is larger.\\n\\n\\n### Debt\\n\\n - **Down Payment**: \u003cbr/\u003e How much upfront you will be paying for the house\\n   (in your own cash).\\n - **Years**: \u003cbr/\u003e The time after which your mortgage will be fully paid.\\n - **Interest Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e Multiplying this percent by the remaining loan\\n   balance after a given year tells you how much you have to pay your lender\\n   for the privilege of using their money.\\n\\n\\n### Goals\\n\\n - **Investment Growth Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e How much you expect your other investments\\n   to grow by yearly on average.  This just color-codes the results (green is\\n   better than your other investments, red is worse).\\n - **Investment Tolerance**: \u003cbr/\u003e Results minus this amount from your\\n   investment growth rate will be colored yellow.\\n - **Personal monthly \\\"rent\\\"**: \u003cbr/\u003e This quantifies the amount of value you\\n   personally extract from the home by living in it. This makes comparisons\\n   between investments more fair, because you can't live in a stock! A good\\n   ballpark for this number is your current rent, or a rent that you would be\\n   comfortable paying.\\n - **Max Upfront Costs**: \u003cbr/\u003e The total maximum amount of money upfront you\\n   can spend on the house. Used for color coding.\\n - **Max Monthly Costs**: \u003cbr/\u003e The maximum amount of money you can spend on\\n   the house per month **on average**. You should always have some buffer,\\n   since many housing expenses come in large lump payments.  Used for color\\n   coding.\\n - **Portfolio Start Size**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money you have in your\\n   investment portfolio when you buy the home. Used to calculate how much of\\n   your investment portfolio is made up of by the house\\n - **Yearly Investment**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money you are investing per year\\n   into your portfolio.  Used to calculate how much of your investment\\n   portfolio is made up of by the house\\n\\n\\n### Income\\n\\n - **Rent**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of rent you expect to earn from tenants living on\\n   your property.\\n - **Percentage Rented**: \u003cbr/\u003e The percentage of your house that is considered\\n   rented. I think you can calculate this using square footage. This determines\\n   how much of all your expenses you can use to cancel out income taxes as a\\n   business expense.\\n - **Occupancy Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e What percent of the time you expect to have rent\\n   flowing in.\\n - **Rental Growth Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e How much you expect rents to increase by in a\\n   year.\\n\\n\\n### Monthly Expenses\\n\\nVarious expenses that need to be paid every month by you on behalf of the whole\\nhouse. Notice the tax deduction rate assumes that these services will be used\\nevenly by you and your tenants.\\n\\n### Selling Costs\\n\\n - **Capital Gains Rate**: \u003cbr/\u003e The percentage of {the price you are selling\\n   the property at minus the amount you bought it for} that you must pay as\\n   tax.  Up to 250k for single owner or 500k for a joint ownership of capital\\n   gains can be ignored for a single family home.  In a duplex, this can be\\n   applied to \u003cPercentage Rented\u003e% of the property, the rest is subject to tax\\n   (unless you do a 1031 exchange).  See\\n   https://finance.zacks.com/rental-income-taxed-duplex-7533.html.  Note also\\n   that if you are using depreciation to offset your income tax while you own\\n   the property, this **lowers your cost basis** in the house, which increases\\n   your capital gains tax.  Additionally, this \\\"depreciation recapture\\\" tax is\\n   taxed at normal income tax rate, since that is what it offset earlier.\\n - **Closing Costs**: \u003cbr/\u003e The percentage of the selling price you have to pay\\n   to agents that help you sell the house. You can reduce this greatly by\\n   selling by owner, but then you might not get the best buyer.\\n\\n\\n### Upfront Buying Costs\\n\\nVarious expenses and fees that you must pay when you are buying the home up\\nfront.\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n - **Time**: \u003cbr/\u003e Year after purchase that you would be selling the house\\n   (assuming \\\"Months Per Row\\\" is set to 12, the default).\\n - **Rental Revenue**: \u003cbr/\u003e Total amount of money paid to you by renters in\\n   that year.\\n - **Property Value**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money you could sell the property\\n   for.\\n - **Property Gain**: \u003cbr/\u003e Amount the property grew in value by in the last\\n   year.\\n - **Net Gain**: \u003cbr/\u003e Amount of money you \\\"made\\\" this year via rent and\\n   property growth.\\n - **Property Tax**: \u003cbr/\u003e \\\"Rent\\\" you must pay your city/government for owning\\n   your property.\\n - **Mortgage Payment**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money that you must pay your\\n   lender towards your loan.\\n - **Interest Paid**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money going to your lender that goes\\n   directly to them as a fee for you using their money.\\n - **Principle Paid**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money going to your lender that\\n   effectively purchases part of your property (equity) from them.\\n - **Loan Amount Left**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of your loan left to pay off.\\n - **Expenses**: \u003cbr/\u003e Total expenses paid from the \\\"Monthly Expenses\\\" input\\n   section.\\n - **Unrecoverable Loss**: \u003cbr/\u003e The total amount of money that you spent this\\n   year that you will never see again :).\\n - **Depreciation**: \u003cbr/\u003e How much of your property you lost as it crumbled to\\n   dust (as far as the IRS is concerned).\\n - **Total Tax Deductions**: \u003cbr/\u003e The total expenses you can deduct as\\n   business expenses from your taxes.\\n - **Taxable Income**: \u003cbr/\u003e The income from your property that is taxable as\\n   ordinary income.\\n - **Income Tax Paid**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of income tax you actually need to pay\\n   this year because you own your property.\\n - **Total Expense**: \u003cbr/\u003e The total amount you must pay this year to others.\\n - **Cash Flow**: \u003cbr/\u003e The total amount paid to you by others minus the total\\n   amount you must pay to others.\\n - **Monthly Cash Flow**: \u003cbr/\u003e The last column divided by \\\"Months Per Row\\\".\\n - **\\\"Rent\\\"**: \u003cbr/\u003e The total amount of value you extract from living in the\\n   property (see \\\"Goals\\\" input section).\\n - **\\\"Rent\\\" Cashflow**: \u003cbr/\u003e Cashflow considering the \\\"rent\\\" you are \\\"paying\\\".\\n - **Money Put In**: \u003cbr/\u003e The total amount of money you have spent on the\\n   property.\\n - **Rest of Portfolio Value**: \u003cbr/\u003e The value of your investments, minus the\\n   house.\\n - **Percent of Portfolio**: \u003cbr/\u003e The percentage of the portfolio that is made\\n   up of by the house.\\n - **Money Put In w/\\\"Rent\\\"**: \u003cbr/\u003e The \\\"Money Put In\\\" column considering the\\n   \\\"rent\\\" you are \\\"paying\\\".\\n - **Cost to Sell**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money you need to pay to others when\\n   selling the house.  This includes paying off the mortgage, paying realtors,\\n   etc.\\n - **Depreciation Recapture**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money you have written off\\n   your taxes so far due to property depreciation - if the property value has\\n   increased despite this depreciation, you need to pay it back.\\n - **Cost Basis**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount you bought the house for plus any\\n   improvements, adjusted by how much of it you own this year.\\n - **Capital Gains**: \u003cbr/\u003e How much your property has appreciated since you\\n   bought it, adjusted for how much of it you own this year.\\n - **Total Sale Tax**: \u003cbr/\u003e How much in tax you would have to pay if you sold\\n   the property this year, including capital gains tax and depreciation\\n   recapture income tax.\\n - **Sale Proceeds**: \u003cbr/\u003e The amount of money you would end up with in cash\\n   after the sale of the property this year.\\n - **IRR**: \u003cbr/\u003e The time-adjusted rate of return you have made on all the\\n   money you put into the property.\\n - **IRR w/\\\"Rent\\\"**: \u003cbr/\u003e The time-adjusted rate of return you have made on\\n   all the money you put into the property, considering also the value you got\\n   out of it by living in it.  **If this value is less than your expected\\n   investment growth rate, financially you probably shouldn't buy the house.**\\n - **Portfolio Return w/\\\"Rent\\\"**: \u003cbr/\u003e The return of your entire portfolio\\n   including the house, given that you sell the house this year.\\n - **Rental Delta**: \u003cbr/\u003e To translate the rate of return to a \\\"dollars per\\n   month\\\" figure, fill in the top cell of this column until the **IRR w/Rent\\n   Delta** column matches your expected **Investment Growth Rate** for the year\\n   you are planning to sell at.

The bond cannot be sold for 1 year.\\n1. If sold before 5 years, you lose the last 3 months of interest.\\n1. You must pay income tax on earnings when the bonds are sold.\\n1. The rate is reindexed to inflation every 6 months, so this return will only\\n   come as long as inflation is high.\\n\\nKiplinger again:\\n\\n\u003e Inflation is not done yet.\\n\u003e Prices continued to rise strongly for basics such as food, rent and new\\n\u003e vehicles.\\n\u003e There is some evidence that food prices may be moderating after a year’s worth\\n\u003e of large monthly increases.\\n\u003e But continuing large wage increases at many businesses are likely to keep upward\\n\u003e pressure on most prices for some time to come.\\n\u003e Expect price inflation at the end of the year to be around 8.0%, down a bit from\\n\u003e the peak of 9.1% in June, but still high.\\n\u003e Inflation will likely fall to around 3%-4% by the end of next year if the\\n\u003e economy slows, as expected.\\n\\nFrom the [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-forecast.htm):\\n\\n![forecast](/docs/investing-and-finances/inflation-forecast.png)\\n\\nSo it looks like if I buy these bonds now I will probably get a year out of them\\nbefore I will want to go back into the stock market.\\nWith income tax on earnings plus the 3 month interest payback, I'm likely\\nlooking at a return of 9.6% for 6 months, then 7% for 6 months, then 0% for 3\\nmonths (because I lose the last 3 months), or 6.64% interest.\\nAfter a ~35% tax (I expect to sell the rest of my investments only when my\\nincome and therefore tax rate is much lower), this ends up being **4.32%**.\\n\\nThis is much better than the 0% rate I am getting on the $5-10k I keep in my\\nbank account (I know, I live dangerously...), but at the cost of liquidity,\\nespecially for the first year.\\nIt's not really an emergency fund if you can't withdraw it.\\n\\nI'm not convinced that this rate will beat the stock market overall in the next\\nyear though.\\n\\nSo if I'm not using the bonds as an emergency fund, it comes down to: do I think\\nthat the market will grow less than ~4.5% in the next year?\\nFor me the answer is no right now.\\n\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nhttps://totalrealreturns.com/ gives a good visualization of returns and\\nvolatility for different investments.\\n\\n\\n## Stock options\\n\\n - [Excellent Reference](\\n   http://www.scribd.com/doc/55945011/An-Introduction-to-Stock-Options-for-the-Tech-Entrepreneur-or-Startup-Employee)\\n\\n\\n## The Value Factor\\n\\nInvestment returns can theoretically be explained by different factors\\n[described here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTnIebSzj4).

If you've held the stock for \u003c 1\\nyear, it is taxed as ordinary income; otherwise it is taxed at a lower capital\\ngains rate. [This Motley Fool\\npage](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/selling-stock-taxes/)\\nhas a good explanation with examples. \\n\\nNote that your capital gains themselves help determine your capital gains tax\\nrate. If you make no ordinary income, but sell stock resulting in a $1 million\\ngain, your income for the purposes of determining your capital gains tax rate\\nwill be $1 million. You will **not** pay ordinary income tax on this amount,\\nbut instead the 20% (in 2021) capital gains tax rate for this income level.\\n\\nIf you are making\\n[significant](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax/large-gains-lump-sum-distributions-etc/large-gains-lump-sum-distributions-etc)\\ncapital gains over the year and are not offsetting this amount by for example\\nhaving your employer withhold more tax, you must pay taxes quarterly to the IRS\\n[here](https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay). If you do not, you may need to\\npay an underpayment pentalty when it comes time to file your tax return.\\n\\n## Optimizing Capital Gains When Retired\\n\\nIf you are retired and need \u003c ~$40k per year to live (in 2021), you could\\nsurvive by selling \u003c ~$40k of stock per year (which should definitely have \u003c\\n~$40k of capital gains) and pay 0% capital gains tax.\\n\\n## Tax Loss Harvesting\\n\\nGood descriptions:\\n\\n - https://hackyourwealth.com/tax-loss-gain-harvesting\\n - https://www.moneyunder30.com/profit-from-tax-loss-harvesting\\n - https://www.madfientist.com/tax-loss-harvesting/\\n\\n1. Sell your losing investment.\\n1. Buy another (intermediate) investment that you are happy holding.\\n1.

(Please cover: devices used, scenario selection, post-processing, data storage, and long-term use cases.)**\\n\\nI currently use Mementodb on my phone and computer to log notable events that\\nhappen during the day.\\nI usually log 1-3 events per day.\\nEach log is a line or two of text, with some categorization tags and a general\\npositive-negative rating of the event.\\nI go back and read this log when I feel like it, and am consistently surprised\\nby how well it sparks vivid memories of even long past events.\\n\\nI use my own tool https://github.com/kovasap/autojournal-on-gas to collect\\ninformation from ActivityWatch running on my computers, and a location logging\\napp on my phone, to pull information about what I'm up to into my Google\\ncalendar to a visual representation of my activity.\\nIt also sends me emails summarizing my Mementodb lifelog, and puts the events on\\nmy calendar as well.\\nThis tools runs automatically in the background via Google Apps Script.\\nI have been actively using this tool less in recent times, but occasionally I'll\\nlook at the calendar to remember stuff.\\nUnfortunately, my computer logging has recently broken and I haven't been\\nmotivated to fix it (it's probably a simple issue).\\n\\nI have a program regularly take screenshots of my computer screen and upload\\nthem to Google photos.\\nThis is described at\\nhttps://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file#automatic-screenshooting.\\n\\nI have a recurring reminder on my phone to take a picture of the real world,\\nwhich is then stored in google photos.\\n\\n[My \\\"Daily Habits\\\" page]({{\u003c relref\\n\\\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/daily-habits.md\\\" \u003e}}) should have an up to date\\n\\\"lifelogging\\\" section that may change in the future with what I actually do.\\nI never plan to update this page (it is a snapshot).\\n\\n**What is the biggest challenge you face in your lifelogging process? How do you currently handle it?**\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges I did face was motivating myself to do manual\\nlogging.\\nMy big breakthrough was to focus on logging the things that made me feel most\\npassionate and treat the logging as a conversation with another person (and only\\nlog things I felt were worth sharing with that hypothetical person).\\nWith this perspective, logging is much easier now.\\n\\nI tried [rolling my own automatic camera lifelogging system]({{\u003c relref\\n\\\"/docs/lifelogging/camera.md\\\" \u003e}})), but managing the mass volume of data from\\nthe camera was too hard.\\nThe Narrative Clip, which I tried afterward, was amazingly better.\\nToo bad they shut the service down or I would be still using it.\\n\\nI was also very motivated for a time to find a way to have a microphone record\\nme at all times and translate all the conversations I had to a text \\\"script\\\".\\nI could never figure out how to technically accomplish this, but would be super\\nexcited to try a solution here.\\nI feel that lifelogging can have a data volume problem, but a simple text script\\nof your day I think would be very easy to read/digest/postprocess compared to\\nother forms of lifelogging data.\\n\\n**Do you have any memorable lifelogging-related stories you’d like to share with us?**\\n\\nNot specifics, but as stated earlier I am consistently amazed at how vivid the\\nmemories my lifelog triggers can be, even of very old events.\\n\\n**We’ve designed a lifelogging device with the following specs:**\\n\\n - Weight: ~30g (wearable/clippable)\\n - Features: Interval photo/video, audio recording. etc\\n - Battery life: ~2 days\\n - AI integration: Auto-categorization \u0026 video clipping\\n\\n**Would you be willing to use this product? Do you see any potential shortcomings?**\\n\\nYes definitely!\\n\\nI worry that the data generated will need to be stored somewhere, which will\\nlead to a monthly subscription fee requirement.\\nI would much rather have an option to aggressively cull data, pay a larger\\nupfront fee, or manage my own data somehow than need to pay a subscription.\\n\\n**Which features interest you most, or features you want that we didn't provide?**\\n\\nAs noted above, if you can do speech-to-text and output a script of each day\\nfrom the microphone that would be amazing!\\n\\n**What's your top concern regarding this product/system?

The\\n\\\"Quantified Self\\\" concept is closely related to this, although I see it as\\nbeing more specific about what it is focusing on (namely numerical\\nmeasurements).\\n\\n## Why?\\n\\nThere are two primary reasons why lifelogging interests me:\\n\\n1. Lifelogging promises to provide a perfect record that I could refer back to\\n   when trying to remember something. Some examples of things that would be\\n   nice to remember more accurately:\\n   - The ideas in an engaging conversation\\n   - The places I was in the last day where I should look for my missing keys\\n   - The stuff I did during the last week when trying to figure out what\\n     projects to continue working on.\\n   - The stuff I did over the last weekend when someone asks \\\"how was your\\n     weekend?\\\".\\n1. Finding correlations in, or otherwise analyzing, lifelogging data could lead\\nto clear insights about which behaviors lead to better health, more desirable\\nstates of mind, and better life outcomes however you want to define them.\\n   - See my [Tracking Health]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/tracking-health.md\\\" \u003e}})\\n   page for more details.\\n\\n## An Ideal System\\n\\nThe primary issue with lifelogging is that collecting even small amounts of\\ninformation consistently can be very time consuming. This is exacerbated if you\\nare not running a specific experiment on yourself that requires very targeted\\ncollection, but are rather trying to paint a picture of your life that could be\\nused for more generic analysis and memory-aiding.\\n\\nTherefore, my ideal lifelogging system would be totally automatic. This could\\nbe achieved with the following components:\\n\\n - A GPS monitor logging my location.\\n   - Done using [GPSLogger](https://gpslogger.app/)\\n - Tracking food consumption via photos.\\n   - Done using [autojournal](https://github.com/kovasap/autojournal) + Google\\n     Photos.\\n   - Plan to move to [MomentoDB](https://mementodatabase.com/) for this.\\n - A wearable camera that sees what I see and stores the video somewhere.\\n   - Partially done using a [snapcam]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/lifelogging/camera.md\\\"\\n     \u003e}})\\n - A wearable microphone that hears what I hear, and transcribes all heard\\n   speech to a searchable text log, like a script to the play that is my life.\\n   - Not done yet, see https://roberdam.com/en/wisper.html\\n     (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33608437) for prior art!\\n - Programs that log what I'm doing on my various devices (laptop, phone,\\n   etc.).\\n   - Almost done with [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/).\\n   - Previously/currently done with\\n     [selfspy](https://github.com/selfspy/selfspy).\\n - Tracking Exercise\\n   - Should be inferrable from my location tracking, but I haven't written the\\n     logic yet.\\n - Tracking habit adherence. Like exercise or practicing a skill.\\n   - I found [proactively assigning myself to do a habit at a specific time]({{\u003c\\n     relref \\\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/task-tracking.md\\\" \u003e}})\\n     works very well, and this has the added benefit of tracking when I tick\\n     off my assignment as \\\"done\\\". I use Google Tasks for this, which show up on\\n     my Google Calendar. Ideally I would write code to save my task data so\\n     that it could be visualized in other places (and so deleted tasks wouldn't\\n     disappear from history).\\n - Various sensors that track mood and health metrics.\\n   - Manually done with [MomentoDB](https://mementodatabase.com/), therefore\\n     not consistent :/\\n   - Previously done with [Nomie](https://nomie.app/), which IMO is strictly\\n     worse than MomentoDB.\\n - Logic that tries to infer meaningful \\\"events\\\" from the datastreams collected\\n   by these components. For example, image processing software analyzing my\\n   camera feed coupled with GPS data could infer that I was playing soccer from\\n   1-2pm on Saturday.\\n   - Not done yet\\n - A place to store all the collected data.\\n   - Done with [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)\\n - A calendar or timeline -like visualization system that provides a\\n   scrollable, searchable way to browse all the generated life events.\\n   - Partially done with [autojournal](https://github.com/kovasap/autojournal).\\n   - See [continuous glucose monitoring experiment]({{\u003c relref\\n     \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/continuous-glucose-monitoring.md\\\" \u003e}}) for a\\n     timeline view.\\n - A tool that can find correlations in the stored data and in general condense\\n   it down to insights.

Moving your body is good for you, especially when regularly\\n   done. If you have to go to work every day, it makes sense to couple that\\n   mandatory travel with exercise to make the exercise \\\"mandatory\\\" itself!\\n1. **Inexpensive**. Especially if you buy cheap bikes, bike commuting might be\\n   the least expensive way to travel around a city short of walking.\\n1. **On your own terms**. For me, it's important to be on my own schedule and\\n   not have to worry about public transportation schedules and parking time\\n   limits. Biking is not the only way to accomplish this, but it does a good\\n   job at it.\\n\\n## Downsides\\n\\n1. Requires living in an area where everyday needs (work, grocery, etc.) are\\n   close by. Living in these areas is usually more expensive. This is not\\n   really a con if you want to live in these areas for other reasons.\\n1. If you do not have a car, then it can be logistically harder to participate\\n   in certain activities, which will probably end up with you simply not doing\\n   them consistently.\\n\\n## Listening while Biking\\n\\nI highly recommend listening to audiobooks or podcasts when biking to both be\\nentertained and maybe learn some stuff or get inspired while you're at it.\\n\\nI used to do this by putting some large studio-style over-ear headphones over\\nmy *helmet* so that the speakers would not sit on my ears, but rather a couple\\ninches away from them. This worked pretty well, although it did look kinda\\nsilly.\\n\\nSince then I've switch to using \\\"bone-conduction\\\" headphones like\\n[these](https://amzn.to/3j79zfw) (I can't find my originally purchased ones).\\nIn my experience, these just act like tiny speakers that are close to your\\nears, but not in them - I don't get much \\\"bone-conduction\\\" effect from my pair.\\n\\nHowever you listen when biking, I highly recommend making sure you can still\\nhear what's going on around you for safety.\\n\\n## Buying a Bike\\n\\nI personally recommend buying a cheap, used bike for commuting. There are\\nseveral reasons for this:\\n\\n - Maintaining an expensive bike's high performance can itself be expensive and\\n   time consuming, especially if you ride it a lot, which you would be doing if\\n   you are commuting. A cheaper bike with worse performance will require less\\n   maintenance to keep it at its current performance level, and you can even\\n   just let it fall into disrepair and get another cheap bike when it becomes\\n   unusable. This makes the assumption that performance for commuting is not\\n   that important (it isn't for me).\\n - It's easier to buy multiple bikes if they are cheap, which has several\\n   benefits:\\n    - You can try out different styles of bike and/or bikes with different\\n      features over a longer time window.\\n    - If one bike has a problem that might take a couple days to resolve (e.g.\\n      if you are waiting for a part delivery), you still have a bike to use.\\n - Bike theft is a real problem, and having a used bike (1) makes your bike a\\n   less attractive target for thieves and (2) makes any theft that does occur\\n   less painful. AFAIK no lock perfectly secures your bike, and few/no locks\\n   secure individual bike components.\\n\\nIn a big city like Seattle, there are a lot of people selling bikes, so they\\nare usually pretty easy to find. I use [craigslist](https://craigslist.org/)\\nand [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) for this.\\n\\n## Modifications\\n\\n### Milk Crate\\n\\nThe best way I've found to transport stuff on a bike is a back rack + milk\\ncrate combo:\\n\\n![Milk Crate](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/bike_milk_crate.jpg)\\n\\nThis securely holds things that are just placed in it (like a backpack).\\nPreviously I used straps to secure bags to the bike rack itself, but this is\\nmuch easier.  This is also **much** more pleasant than actually wearing a\\nbackpack when biking, especially if you don't want to sweat too much.\\n\\n## Rainy Weather\\n\\nOne of the worst parts of bike commuting is getting wet on the way in to work\\nand not being able to dry off.  For me, most of my cloths dry pretty quickly in\\nthe generally light Seattle rain, but my shoes and socks do not. This is\\npartially because of their relative thickness and also because they are usually\\nexposed to the most water. Even when it is not actively raining, biking on wet\\nground can toss up a good amount of water on- or into my shoes.\\n\\nI've found the best solution to this problem by far is wearing some kind of\\nwaterproof shoe covers like [these](https://amzn.to/3NvMFMK).\\n\\n## Maintenance\\n\\nMost bike maintenance is not that hard to learn, and you will save lots of time\\nand money in the long run if you learn some basics. Here I list the most common\\nproblems that can be easily addressed DIY. Check out YouTube for good tutorials\\nif I haven't linked any myself. \\n\\nMost repairs require some specialized tools, which are pretty cheap on Amazon\\n(usually less expensive than having the repair done professionally once).\\n\\nA good site for learning more is https://www.sheldonbrown.com.\\n\\n### Flat Tires\\n\\nI like to keep a couple tubes (like [this one](https://amzn.to/3qN1r87)) around\\nfor an easy change. I also use patch kits for small punctures.\\n\\nYou'll also need [tire levers](https://amzn.to/3JyEIDg) to remove your tire.\\n\\nWhen changing a tube, keep in mind that your tube was damaged by something.\\nThis could be:\\n\\n - Something that punctured your tire. Run your hands along the inside of your\\n   tire near the puncture to make sure that nothing sharp is still embedded in\\n   your tire!\\n - Your tire itself has a hole in it.\\n - Your tube folded as it inflated, or was otherwise pinched.\\n\\nYou don't want to change your tube only to have your new tube break for the\\nsame reason!\\n\\n### Skipping Gears\\n\\nSometimes when you bike you may notice skipping when pedaling, especially when\\npedaling hard. This is usually quite jarring and in bad cases can make your\\nbike fairly unridable. This issue can be caused by several different problems:\\n\\n#### 1. Misaligned Shifters\\n\\nYour gear shifters may put the chain in between two of the cogs that it wraps\\naround. To fix this, usually shifters can be shifted around by tighting or\\nloosening a screw on them.\\n\\n#### 2. A Stretched Chain\\n\\nOver time, bike chains stretch.  An overly stretched chain can lead to\\nskipping, as the distance between the links no longer properly matches the\\ndistances between the teeth on the cog. See\\nhttps://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/when-to-replace-a-chain-on-a-bicycle\\nfor a good overview of this problem.\\n\\n**TIP:** When replacing the chain, sometimes using a chain tool to drive the\\ncylindrical bit through the two links to close the loop will result in a \\\"stiff\\\"\\nlink.\\nBasically the two links of the chain on either side of the bit you just drove\\nthrough will not rotate freely along the bit like the other links.\\nOne common reason this happens is because the pressure from driving the bit will\\n*press the outer link firming against the inner one*.\\nTo fix this, simply put some metal pliers or the like into the gap between the\\ntwo outer link's sides and twist to push the sides further apart!\\n\\n#### 3. Worn Cogs\\n\\nJust like chains can wear out, so can the cogs they wrap around.  This happens\\nmore slowly, and I've heard can be slowed even further by regularly replacing\\nyour chain (presumably stretched chains wear out cogs faster). When a cog is\\nworn, skipping occurs for the same reason as when a chain is worn - there is a\\nmisfit between the chain and the cog. Cogs can also break teeth, making this\\neven worse! \\n\\nNote when replacing cogs that there are two types, freewheels and cassettes.\\nIt is crucial to know which one you have before attempting a replacement! Check\\nout these sites for more details:\\n\\n - https://www.sheldonbrown.com/free-k7.html\\n - https://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/determining-cassette-freewheel-type\\n\\nI've made the mistake before of trying to replace the wrong type of cog, and\\nit's not fun.\\n\\n### Stuck Seatpost\\n\\nI had a very persistent problem for a while of my seatpost being stuck in a\\nspecific position on one of my bikes.  I think the root cause was corrosion\\nfusing the post to the frame, but am not completely sure.  I tried very hard\\nfor a long time to fix this, as the seat was slightly too high and I suspect\\nthis was causing me [pain in my left\\nknee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a9vPQ6muSLYFzL1YfB7s90kQxWDijXBOpVjZqCm5GEs/edit#heading=h.4aznx89p4bq7).\\nEventually, a coworker lent me a [pipe wrench](https://amzn.to/3NpLoGN) and I\\nbought some [penetrating lube](https://amzn.to/3zgWxFH).

Wash cloths\\n1. Hang dry - this must happen now because cloths are wet!\\n1. Easily find what you want to wear (since everything is hanging up) and wear\\n   it.\\n\\nI find this easier than my previous workflow, which was:\\n\\n1. Wash cloths\\n1. Transfer to dryer\\n1. Put in laundry bin to fold later\\n1. Never actually fold later and dig through the bin to find stuff when I need\\n   to wear it.  This is especially annoying with socks.  And it leads to\\n   wrinkly cloths.\\n\\nEven if I did fold the cloths, I find that hanging cloths up is easier\\nphysically easier than folding them and putting them away.\\n\\n### Longer Lasting Cloths\\n\\nCloths seem to wear out less quickly for me using this technique.\\nUnfortunately I have no evidence of this and am a biased source, so this may\\nnot actually be true.  I'd be surprised if cloths wore out more quickly though!\\n\\n### Cheaper\\n\\nIf we assume the average cloths dryer using 3000W and drys cloths in 2 hrs,\\nthen to do one load of laundry takes 6kWh.  In Seattle, this would cost\\n`$0.11/kWh * 6kWh = $0.66` per load of laundry.  So not much, but something!\\n\\n\\n## An Old Apartment's System\\n\\nI (use to) hang my cloths above my 4-poster bed, which I find is a pretty\\nefficient use of space:\\n\\n![Empty](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hl1LcVBoja_2GU6FprNhf7y9BQYafNIkDOwQKdfeCndHK5ZakGU-ADtDDxulY6t56hN7GPwPtvSMNrOgv9hnsiB27C3jhDvo6R9gGpiKM61wCZvt-gJ06WOwCYvFC3rAcTNs9A6i5t8=w2400)\\n\\n![Corner](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gGe-CRep0Y80Nsf4RvequnkzTJ0fdz3hAA8JeaoH2I5t1vwECWhyB9tIjb7an8mZ6fYTzSKrwVVqlNHzb5uhDwkJxagJKpUh6ZWQiw2eiJkMZuBMuQCwFgkL5-hh1tKuA21PG9iWriY=w2400)\\n\\n![Cloths](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KYh_H0WnC-_2hH8acCdnNXibKdHbKgBDmuc6P8R7S0nZVkUohAqe5qutcbY5fvZMa04i18BWLmH5NDWx3os7AEVsKpcnP2xV2HR9fn_e2hAI7ieLburs0g-UYTOcxmHM7UsHrqu3TOE=w2400)\\n\\nOne thing to be careful of is the weight of the cloths on the structure you're\\nusing, which can be significant!\\n\\n\\n## Using Hangers\\n\\nA good system I use as of 2022 is to put wet shirts on hangers, which I then\\nhang on a clothesline.

The furthest-in thumb key was very hard to reach, and borderline unusable.\\n2. The pinky column stagger was not pronounced enough, making me often use my\\n   ring finger to hit the top pinky key.\\n\\nThe Kaly42 promised to solve both of these problems, and I'd been wanting to try\\nbuilding a board from scratch anyway.\\n\\n#### Parts\\n\\nI used the parts list on the Kaly and Cantor (which the Kaly is based on) GitHub\\npages to guide my purchases.\\nI bought everything on Aliexpress except for keycaps and switches, which came\\nfrom lowprokb.ca.\\nThe PCB I got from JCLPCB.\\n\\nAt first I bought the wrong microcontroller from Aliexpress.\\nIt may have been the right spec, was was too wide to fit on the board.\\nI ended up using [this\\npost](https://github.com/Dwctor/Kaly/issues/6#issuecomment-2365386452) to get\\none that would work.\\n\\nI hopefully thought my microcontroller would come with pins and sockets so that\\nI could make it removable (in case it broke when installed on the board), but it\\ndid not.\\nI ended up sourcing some low profile sockets from a coworker.\\nNext time I would definitely buy sockets up front to make sure I had them.\\n\\n#### Build Process\\n\\nThis was my first soldering job, so a good amount of learning was involved.\\nSpecifically, it took me a while to get used to the fact that some part of the\\nkeyboard took way longer to heat up than others when soldering, and I often\\napplied solder too early while the metal was still too cold, leading to an ugly\\nconnection.\\n\\nSome of my connections worked right after soldering, but failed after a couple\\nhours exposed to colder temps.\\n\\n![kaly_in_progress](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/kaly_in_progress.jpg)\\n*Midway\\nthrough the build, here I was trying to decide if I should use the large sockets\\navailable at my makerspace, or solder directly onto the board.\\nLuckily I was able to find shorter sockets from a coworker that gave me the best\\nof both worlds.*\\n\\n#### Final Product\\n\\n![kaly](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/kaly.jpg)\\n\\n![kaly_on_wood](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/kaly_on_wood.jpg)\\n\\n![kaly_on_desk](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/kaly_on_desk.jpg)\\n\\n#### Keymap\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kovasap/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/kaly/kaly42/keymaps/kovasap/keymap.c\\n\\n### Lintilla\\n\\n#### Motivation\\n\\nAfter using my Kaly42 for a while, there were some minor issues that were\\nconsistenly annoying me.\\nI detailed these issues at\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1i6q9ih/searching_for_keyboard_42_key_split_staggered/.\\nA commenter helpfully suggested the\\n[Lintilla](https://github.com/ctranstrum/lintilla) keyboard, which looked to\\nsolve all of my problems, plus add some nice new features like being wireless.\\n\\n#### Build Process\\n\\nThe instructions on the Lintilla GitHub page for getting parts and building the\\nboard were phenomenal.\\nIn no small part due to the high quality instructions, building the Lintilla was\\njust as easy or easier than building the Kaly42 despite being a more complex\\nboard.\\n\\nI did run into a couple hiccups that might be useful for others to know:\\n\\n - Finding the M2 screws and hex nuts was surprisingly difficult in my local\\n   area.\\n   The hardware stores I tried only had down to M3.\\n   I ended up ordering many more than I needed from Amazon.\\n - Ordering the Xiao microcontrollers from Seeedstudio in China took 30 days to\\n   deliver.\\n   Maybe I just got unluchy.\\n - At first I put the microcontrollers on both sides of the board backwards.\\n   One of them I removed (and destroyed :( ) by grilling it on a hot plate.\\n   Luckily the other one I was able to save by removing it with a hot air gun.\\n - I had some other minor issues during the build that are documented at\\n   https://github.com/ctranstrum/lintilla/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Akovasap.\\n   The keyboard creator was extremely helpful in helping me work through these\\n   issues, and several of the issues led to repository updates that will solve\\n   the problems for future builders.\\n\\n\\n![Mid build lintilla](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/mid-build-lintilla.jpg)\\n\\n![lintilla xiao wrong side](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/lintilla-wrong-side-xiao.jpg)\\n*Note how the microcontroller is incorrectly on the top of the board, whereas\\nall the sockets/diodes are on the bottom!*\\n\\n#### Final Product\\n\\n![lintilla](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/lintilla-both.jpg)\\n\\n![lintilla one side](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/lintilla-right.jpg)\\n*Except for the middle thumb key, the keycaps are colored by the finger that will use them.*\\n\\n![lintilla other side](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/lintilla-left.jpg)\\n*I tried out some [\\\"convex\\\" or \\\"thumb\\\"\\nkeycaps](https://typeractive.xyz/products/mbk-keycaps?_pos=1\u0026_sid=79cf78d62\u0026_ss=r\u0026variant=46728680407271)\\non the thumb keys, and it is incredible how much more comfortable they are to\\nuse than the normal keycaps with the sharpish edges.*\\n\\n![lintilla with kaly](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/lintilla-with-kaly.jpg)\\n*My finished Lintilla, with my Kaly42 behind it.\\nI like using gloves as wrist rests, and have even attached some to my kaly with\\nstrings.\\nThese rests double as \\\"cases\\\" I can flip on top of the keycaps to protect them\\nfor transport when I put the keybord halves back-to-back.\\nI'll probably end up doing something similar for the Lintilla.*\\n\\n#### Keymap\\n\\nhttps://github.com/kovasap/zmk-config/blob/main/config/lintilla.keymap\\n\\n## Normal Keyboard Usage\\n\\nAs much as I like my custom keyboards, sometimes it's just more convenient to\\nuse my laptop keyboard.\\nTo make it nicer, I use xkb on linux to implement something like\\nhttps://dreymar.colemak.org/ergo-mods.html#angle-wide.\\nMy config is at https://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles/tree/master/keyboard.\\n\\n## Inspiration and other projects\\n\\n -

I made [a\\nhotkey](https://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles/blob/1c6706b9df29d8ae7a1f214bb6dcba7474e77d15/.config/qtile/config.py#L158)\\nto run this scipt in my window manager (QTile). So now when I want to watch a\\nYouTube video I just need to copy the url to my clipboard and then hit \\\"mod-y\\\"\\non my keyboard (mod is the windows key)!

Not only is it tiring, but I frequently\\nfail at it; some of the tasks will just evaporate from my memory, only to be\\nrecalled a day later (or when there is a serious problem stemming from the task\\nnot being done). This isn't helped by \\\"trying harder\\\". Doing so only makes me\\n\\\"panic-remember\\\" a task every 5 minutes or so, pulling me completely out of\\nwhatever else I was doing.\\n\\nTrying to remember tasks I've found also has a large negative impact on my\\nsleep quality. The cycle of \\\"panic-remembering\\\" leads to me sleeping lightly\\nand waking up whenever the remembering happens.\\n\\n## Mobile Reminders\\n\\nAn amazing solution to my above problem has been using reminders on my\\nsmartphone to keep tasks out of my head, but still make sure they are done. I\\npersonally use Google Tasks, but I'm sure other reminder apps would work just\\nas well. My system works like this:\\n\\n1. Think of something that needs to be done, or be asked to do something by\\n   another person.\\n1. Add a task on my phone with a description of the work.\\n1. **Set a time on the task when I think I'll be free to tackle it.**\\n1. Get notified of the task at the time I set.\\n1. Do the task, or postpone it; or do some work towards the task and postpone\\n   it for later follow up.\\n\\nThis system works very well compared to e.g. a to-do list, because it\\nexplicitly considers what time I'll be in the right mindset and have the right\\ncontext to do each item. I don't need to periodically scan my list and\\nre-remember every task when figuring out what to do next.\\n\\nThis system also makes it easy to set recurring tasks, or tasks in the far\\nfuture (months to years away). I've never been able to consistently remember to\\ndo these kinds of tasks before using this system.\\n\\n## Building Habits\\n\\nSetting recurring reminders at specific times is also an extremely effective\\nway of building [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). I find\\nthat doing this proactively is much better than trying to track adherence to a\\nhabit reactively (e.g. tracking workouts).\"\n  :name \"task-tracking.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Lifestyle Optimizations\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 2331\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655691154\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1645741892\n                                 1630642518]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Lifestyle Optimizations\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/taut-line-hitch.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Taut Line Hitch\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Lifestyle Optimizations\\\"}\\n---\\n# The Most Useful Knot in the World (Taut-line hitch)\\n\\nThis knot allows you to adjust its location on a string **after** you've tied\\nit, and it stays in said location even under a lot of force.\\n\\nSee [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taut-line_hitch) for instructions\\non how to tie.

Spending time untangling this web of interactions for\\noneself is a worthy endeavor that has personally helped me feel more\\nconsistently energetic.  Also a deeper understanding of these interactions will\\nprobably make you live longer!\\n\\n**Vision**: Vision is a clear path for how to achieve the goal in question, or\\nat least for how to get closer to achieving said goal.  Acquiring vision can be\\ntricky and fickle.  For me, it helps to:\\n\\n - Somewhat aimlessly learn about the area of knowledge the goal is in by\\n   reading what other people have written/said about it.  Sometimes reading\\n   about even completely unrelated topics can spark ideas about the original\\n   goal. Audiobooks and podcasts are great for getting this exposure.\\n - Plant \\\"seeds\\\" in my head relating to the goal.  These usually manifest as\\n   questions I'm curious to know the answers to, or very rough theories that I\\n   can't even put into words for how the goals might be achieved.\\n - Sleep on my knowledge to find new connections and/or grow the seeds (see\\n   [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)).\\n - Do cardiovascular exercise like hiking or running to find new connections\\n   and/or help grow the seeds.  Not sure how this helps (more blood flow to the\\n   brain?), but it usually does for me.\\n - Take a long break from the goal and work on another goal.  Having multiple\\n   in-flight projects at once makes this more natural.\\n - Set up my environment and habits so that I am consistently exposed to the\\n   goal, making it more likely my thoughts will wander to it and make progress\\n   decoding it.\\n - Spend time writing about how I might achive the goal, or make a more\\n   concrete plan on paper as I know more.\\n   This will help keep me on track once I get started doing tasks, and helps\\n   avoid the problem of finishing something then not knowing what to do next.\\n - See also [creativity]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/mind/creativity.md\\\" \u003e}}) (maybe I\\n   should merge these sections).\\n\\n### Wisdom\\n\\nWisdom to me means a relative lack of surprise with the behavior of the world\\naround oneself.  By this definition, to become wise is to build an effective\\nmodel of the world in one's head that can predict what will happen\\nconsistently, thus avoiding surprise.  Because the world is often\\nunpredictable, wisdom also means not expecting things of the world that cannot\\nbe expected.  For example, there are many catastrophes that could happen at any\\nmoment, causing severe damage to one's life - handling these with grace as\\nopposed to feeling the negative emotions that come with unmet expectations is\\nperhaps wise.\\n\\nThis is discussed in a lot more detail by [Stoic\\nphilosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).  My reading of this work\\nis that the universe behaves logically and the better one understands this\\nuniversal reason (logos), the more in harmony with the universe one will be.\\n\\nWisdom also means recognizing that attaining accurate knowledge is often\\npainstaking work, and therefore to be wise is to be patient with learning and\\nnot try to take shortcuts when understanding the truth is important.  See [What\\nto believe]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe.md\\\" \u003e}})\\nfor discussion of this.\\n\\nWisdom may be related to a well developed \\\"System 1\\\" as described in\\n[_Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel\\nKahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).\\n\\nOne danger with chasing wisdom is believing that all the time you've spend\\n\\\"getting wiser\\\" by thinking justifies confident snap-opinions on new issues.\\nBuilding models to understand the world requires abstraction, and abstract\\nmodels never perfectly fit new concrete situations. In my opinion recognizing\\nthis limitation, and being willing to put in the work of describing and\\nmodelling the new situation is itself wise. This is highly related to the\\nconcept of [Beginner's Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), which IMO\\nit is wise to cultivate, as opposed to an \\\"expert's mind\\\".\\n\\nRealizing that human knowledge is fallible, but also objectively meaningful and\\nthe accumulation of it makes one objectively wiser is discussed in detail in\\n[The Beginning of\\nInfinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity) by David\\nDeutsch. \\n\\nIn practice, wisdom naturally leads to well-roundedness:\\n\\n#### Well-Roundedness\\n\\nBeing well rounded to me means having a wide range of capabilities.  This has\\nseveral strong benefits:\\n\\n - It reduces single points of failure in life (e.g. injuries or big life\\n   changes leaving one without a purpose/focus).\\n - It makes moments where the world is negatively effecting one in a way which\\n   they are powerless to stop rarer, since it is more likely one will have the\\n   skills necessary to redirect or counter the negative effect.\\n - It makes you more socially interesting to a wider range of different people.\\n   People find capability in specific areas interesting, so more capability in\\n   more areas should make you more interesting to more people.\\n - It allows one to notice and act on more opportunities in life, since most\\n   require some knowledge in their area to detect and exploit. I think it's\\n   reasonable to say that ones ability to discover and make the most of\\n   opportunities has massive impact on the trajectory of ones life.\\n - It hastens learning of new skills and concepts, which often have\\n   similarities to other skills/concepts.  The more you have command of, the\\n   more likely it is that there will be commonalities between the new\\n   skill/concept and one you already know. Also, it can help build abstract\\n   mental concepts by consciously identifying these commonalities and storing\\n   them as a new abstract concept.\\n - It enables formation of novel ideas, which are often just ideas from one\\n   discipline applied to another.\\n\\nOne way to describe this value is as an aspiration to being a [\\\"Renaissance\\nman\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) (See\\n[ERE](https://wiki.earlyretirementextreme.com/wiki/What_is_ERE%3F) for more\\ndiscussion of this.\\n\\nBecoming more well rounded is mostly achieved (in my experience) by seeing\\nroadblocks in life as personal opportunities for growth. Energetically owning\\nand tackling these roadblocks will lead to learning the best ways to get around\\nthem, improving one's breath of knowledge and making similar issues one might\\nencounter later easier to navigate.\\n\\nThe \\\"I can do this\\\" or \\\"I can learn how to do this\\\" sentiment when faced with\\nany issue should lead to an increase in well-roundedness over time.\\n\\nSome areas of knowledge to consider personally deeply understanding to become\\nmore well rounded + tasks to try:\\n\\n - Repair/construction of objects you depend on - try fixing your\\n   computer/cloths/furniture/bike/car/house.\\n - Investing savings - try researching, creating, and executing a personal\\n   investment plan yourself.\\n - Food production - try growing/cooking your own food.\\n\\nSee [a barbell\\nlife](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S2RE1y6PCnvWO5x0_IOWgNHjX23Ulp4ids-i6S67dQM/edit)\\nfor some related thoughts.\\n\\n## Curiosity\\n\\nThe desire to explore novelty.\\n\\nIn [Why Greatness Cannot be Planned]({{\u003c relref\\n\\\"/docs/books/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned.md\\\" \u003e}}), the authors discuss how\\nlarge human advancements necessarily come from people exploring the unknown.\\nI want to be the kind of person that makes doing this a habit.\\nThis has the side benefit of making life seem richer, as novelty leads to\\n[stronger memory formation](https://radiolab.org/podcast/secret-long-life).\\n\\n## Empowerment\\n\\nTo me, personal empowerment is about leveraging vigor and wisdom to achieve\\ngoals.  Empowerment and motivation are near synonyms to me.  Good environment\\nand expectations dramatically help keep up motivation/empowerment.\\n\\nTODO: Merge this with [motivation]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/mind/motivation.md\\\" \u003e}}).\\n\\n### Environment\\n\\nA large chuck of my brain does things in response to environmental stimuli. If\\nI see tasty food, part of my brain will want to eat it. If I am too hot or\\ncold, part of my brain will make a fuss. If I'm with other people, part of my\\nbrain will want to impress or entertain them. \\n\\nBecause of this, crafting an environment that encourages healthy behaviors that\\nhelp you achieve personal goals is really important. I [agree with James\\nClear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) that it is foolish to think your\\nconscious mind can muscle its way past all the other parts that manage\\nenvironmental stimuli to reach its goals.\\n\\nIt's easy to get swept up in life and let your behavior be dictated by your\\nenvironment (e.g. what others around you are doing).\\n\\nIt's dangerous to do this since your environment is not a sentient being and\\ntherefore does not care about anything, let alone your personal\\nhappiness/satisfaction/fulfillment.\\n\\nIt's worth taking a step back and consciously running through whether you agree\\nwith your environment's influence or not frequently.  Otherwise you might end\\nup less happy/satisfied/fulfilled than you might otherwise be.\\n\\nDoing this takes time and energy.  Therefore, if you want to live more\\nintentionally, it is important to give yourself that space/energy and not fill\\nit with other things.\\n\\nOne common and strong environmental force is momentum. It is easier to continue\\ndoing something you are already doing than to switch tasks. This can be used to\\nhelp complete less pleasurable tasks (finishing homework or a workout), but\\nalso can make you continue doing an activity past the point of it's benefit to\\nyou.  Examples of this for me include: eating after already full, playing a\\ngame to the point of frustration, and continuing to browse Reddit or YouTube\\nwithout feeling inspired about what I find. Stopping and checking yourself in\\nthese situations with this idea in mind can help you switch tasks to something\\nthat will be a better overall use of time.  I have a pet theory that your brain\\ngets specifically tired with particular tasks after a couple hours of doing\\nthem, and switching at this point to another task often uses enough different\\nparts of your brain to make you feel very fresh in the new context.\\n\\n\\n### Expectations\\n\\nTODO: fill this in (potentially from the \\\"motivation\\\" doc)\"\n  :name \"manifesto.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Me\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/health-and-longevity/exercise.md\"\n          \"/docs/health-and-longevity/sleep.md\"\n          \"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/food.md\"\n          \"/docs/health-and-longevity/chronic-stress.md\"\n          \"/docs/health-and-longevity/circadian-rhythm.md\"\n          \"/docs/mind/creativity.md\"\n          \"/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe.md\"\n          \"/docs/books/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned.md\"\n          \"/docs/mind/motivation.md\"]\n  :size 11008\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1757135665]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Me\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/me/personal-drama.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Personal Drama\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Me\\\"}\\n---\\nThis file is private\"\n  :name \"personal-drama.md\"\n  :private true\n  :categories #{\"Me\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 49\n  :modtime 1757654772\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [0]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Me\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/me/potential-life-missions.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Potential Life Missions\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Me\\\"}\\n---\\n# Potential Life Missions\\n\\nFinding a way to use my time and resources to make the world a better place is\\na goal of mine.  Here are some roads I could pursue to do that.\\n\\n## Empowering People\\n\\nI currently believe that creative people are the solution to the current\\nproblems facing humanity, and all future problems as well.  See [_Utopia_]({{\u003c\\nrelref \\\"/docs/society/utopia.md\\\" \u003e}}) for more details. Given\\nthis, a high leverage way to make a world a better place is to make it easier\\nfor people to do their thing.\\n\\n### Problem Accessibility\\n\\nLots of big problems today are difficult for the average person to just dive\\ninto. If we could make it so that the average person could effectively use\\ntheir spare time to work on these big problems, and built a culture encouraging\\nthis, we could unlock a lot of latent creative power.\\n\\nWays to do this include:\\n\\n#### Advertising Next Steps\\n\\nMaking more non-fiction content with a \\\"current state of things\\\" or \\\"next\\nsteps\\\" section that encourages individuals to experiment with the frontier.\\n\\n#### Giving People Time\\n\\nGiving people more time/money to dig into problems, e.g. with UBI.\\n\\nhttps://justinmares.com/apply-for-an-trajectory-change-grant/ is an idea.\\n\\n#### Building a Problem-Accessible Culture\\n\\nBuilding open (free to participate in) communities around societal issues.\\n\\n#### Education\\n\\nI think that having students in schools spend more time actually trying to\\ntackle real problems, as opposed to working on contrived assignments might help\\nempower more people.  IMO school in general is too focused on giving students a\\nstrong base of pre-requisite knowledge. Many people (myself included) hold the\\nsentiment that the most important thing they learned in school is \\\"learning how\\nto learn\\\", since much of the actual content they learned is not directly\\nrelevant to the problems they are trying to solve. Despite this, they are still\\nby and large effectively solving those problems that they were not schooled to\\ndo.  I think this is because people have a strong ability to pick up\\npre-requisites quickly when it is obvious why they need to know them given the\\nproblem at hand.\\n\\nTherefore, if we made school either much shorter, or gave students real\\nproblems to work on in a low-risk environment, this may lead to good outcomes.\\n\\n#### [Optimism]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/mind/optimism.md\\\" \u003e}})\\n\\nI currently believe that optimism encourages action.  Therefore, fostering\\noptimism is a good way to empower people to try to solve big problems.\\n\\n### Physical/Mental Health\\n\\nSick people have a reduced capacity to solve problems.  Working on eliminating\\nthe largest causes of sickness would therefore help empower people.\\n\\n#### Aging\\n\\nThe largest cause of sickness in the world today by far.\\n\\nAlso an extreme humanitarian tragedy that dwarfs all others.\\n\\n#### Participating in Biomedical Research\\n\\nAs someone without formal training in biology or medicine, I've found it\\ndifficult to find a way to contribute to biomedical research personally.\\nMost jobs are very competitive (or I am not qualified for them), and based on\\nthe doomerism on r/biotech it seems like even those who are qualified face a\\npretty fraught industry.\\nProbably the best way forward here is to go back to school for a PhD.\\n\\n### Reduce Costs of Common Wants/Needs\\n\\nPeople need to earn money to pay for their basic needs as well as things they\\nare drawn to want.\\nIf we can make most things much cheaper, then the pressure to earn would be\\nreduced.\\n\\n#### Open Sourcing\\n\\nParticipating in things like sci-hub / piracy or open sourcing useful software\\nis one way to reduce these costs.\\n\\n## How?\\n\\n - http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36550615\\n - [Why Greatness Cannot be Planned]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/books/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned.md\\\" \u003e}})\"\n  :name \"potential-life-missions.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Me\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/society/utopia.md\"\n          \"/docs/mind/optimism.md\"\n          \"/docs/books/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned.md\"]\n  :size 3835\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1757135665]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Me\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/me/recent-interests.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Recent Interests\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Me\\\"}\\n---\\n# Recent Interests\\n\\nHere I list stuff I've been interested in recently.\\nI try to update this monthly, using a recurring task to help.\\nI probably forget a lot of things that happen each month :(.\\n\\nTo populate this page, try using my mementodb diary, and\\nhttps://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/chrome-history-for-gemini.zsh.\\n\\n## 2025\\n\\n## February\\n\\n - Routesetting for the Rain City Send climbing competition\\n - Fixing toilet flapper and garbage disposal for tenants\\n - Several iterations of B.

This could be\\ninto the air as speech, onto paper as writing, or into your body as any physical\\nactivity (e.g. dancing, biking, etc.).  In this model, pure professing involves\\nno self reflection or change whatsoever.  If there is adaptation to the\\nunpredictable physical world, it is through if/then branches that choose simply\\nbetween already constructed neural patterns.  \\n\\nBeing in this state requires some combination of practice or training to build\\nthe mental patterns, and a framework of assumptions that keeps the mind from\\nexamining what it is doing too closely.  \\n\\nIn the extreme, pure profession can be animalistic and stubborn. Being in a \\nprofessing state leads to confidence and strong ego.\\n\\nBeing in this state can be physically draining, but mentally I find I can be in this state for a long time before needing a break.\\n\\nPeople tend to express this state more the older they get (i think).\\n\\n\\n### Flow\\n\\nBeing in a strong professing state can lead to a \\\"flow\\\" state, where the world\\nis continually validating your stored patterns and it feels like everything is\\ngoing \\\"right\\\".  I believe this state enables the acts of greatest skill or\\ntalent that are possible for people.  This is a state of “effortless effort” as described in Zen philosophy.\\n\\nI think the key to flow is to always have a readily accessible pathway for your mind to take when it runs into an issue.  Preparation/practice builds these pathways; it is easier to get into flow doing something you have done many times before.\\n\\n\\n## Absorbing - Learning - A State of Observation\\n\\nIn counter to profession, a state of absorption occurs when a mind is focused\\ninstead on taking in new information while making few/no assumptions about the\\nworld.  In this state, instead of continually acting, one continually\\nquestions, expanding the problem space without looking at its details.  This\\nhappens often when being exposed to new information or questioning assumptions\\none has about old information.  New mental connections and memories are being\\ncreated actively in this state.\\n\\nWhen in this state, a mind is very sensitive to any external feedback to\\ncorrect its action.  This can manifest as insecurity or anxiety if pressure is\\napplied during this state of mind.\\n\\nThis state of mind can be paralyzing, as it lays bare the overwhelming\\ncomplexity of everything as you continue to zoom out.  However, it also leads to\\ninteresting connections that you may not see otherwise.\\n\\nExtreme absorption/mindfulness can lead to analysis paralysis or meaningless\\ntheorizing that is too far removed from reality to be useful.  Also\\nprocrastination.\\n\\nYounger people tend to express this state more (i think).  This thought\\ninspired by “How to Change Your Mind” by Michael Pollan.\\n\\nBeing in this state is very draining, as your mind has to constantly\\nreconfigure its thoughts reactively to match external feedback.  For me to be\\nmost effective, I need to take short and long breaks from this state (even\\n“sleeping on” what I’m learning) to solidify memories and make them\\n“professable”.  Too much raw absorption becomes counterproductive, as my mind\\nis too tired to even hold on to the recent changes, let alone make more new\\nones.\\n\\nWhen learning in this state, there will almost always be blind alleys you must\\ngo down to eventually find a model of (or perspective on) the world that works.\\nThis explains why learning can be such a \\\"stop and go\\\" process - it's easy to\\nbe stuck on a concept for a while before it finally clicks.  Also I think one’s\\ntolerance for blind alleys directly correlates to how good they are at\\nlearning.\\n\\n- [Inversion by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/inversion)\\n  - Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to\\n    succeed.\\n\\n\\n## Switching states\\n\\nIn order to get better at something, both absorbing AND professing are equally\\nimportant often in alternating steps.  \\n\\nSee [this Skyline video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLloQvOv1W4) for a\\ndescription about how this process works for a game like Overwatch\\nspecifically.\\n\\nLearning how to do something new under pressure of your own or other’s\\nexpectations can be hard.  Specifically, it is stressful to take mental\\npathways you have recently worked on as an absorber and apply them assuming\\nthey will work (with penalty for failure).  \\n\\nSomeone who “thrives in ambiguity” is bold about applying untested pathways and\\nhas a low fear of failure - or has set expectations properly such that failure\\nis not a big problem.  Alternatively, this person is willing to take on\\nperspectives and run with them even if there is a threat that their taken\\nperspective does not match the perspective/expectations of others they are\\nworking with.  \\n\\n\\n## Ideas to test\\n\\n - Do you actually have a worse memory for events that happened to you when in\\n   a professing state?\\n\\n# Focus\\n\\nThis is unrelated to the above states of mind.  \\n\\nOne way I think of focus is as getting buy in from your mind to fully engage in\\nsome work (mental or physical).  Often the mind expects some pay off for doing\\nthis, since it takes energy and time to be fully engaged.  [This\\nsnippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryB_VQ__KeE) by Jonathan Blow does a\\ngreat job describing how focus can be disrupted ([full\\ninterview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ej_3NKA3pk)).\\n\\nA good way to encourage focus is to set yourself up so that external “things I should also think about” are absent.  For example:\\n\\n - Writing thoughts down so that your brain doesn’t feel pressure to remember\\n   them (else they would be lost).\\n - Keeping your goals “in front” of you.  This could mean laying out your\\n   workspace so that all that’s needed to do your task is at hand.  This could\\n   mean keeping opponents in a game within your field of view.  Being in a\\n   situation where you have to “turn your head around” physically or\\n   metaphorically to keep abreast can lead to breaks in focus.\\n - Putting walls up between yourself and other tasks, like by putting your\\n   phone in another room when trying to focus on something.\\n\\nAnother useful idea is to try to enumerate the things you want to do before\\nstarting on them.  If this list is written down (or even remembered), going\\nback to it can be a stimulus that competes with other environmental\\ndistractions or thoughts.  For instance, a common pattern I notice is (1) I\\ncomplete a task, (2) I have to refocus on something else, (3) some random\\nenvironmental stimulus grabs my focus (e.g. an email, article, chore).  When I\\nhave a list of things I want to do, then those become part of the set of\\nenvironmental stimuli, making it more likely that I do them instead of\\nsomething else.  This system is most effective when the list is very\\naccessible; this could mean physically at hand, or recently created so it is\\nfresh in your mind.  It also helps to consciously pause right after stage (1)\\nabove (completing a task), instead of directly jumping to the next thing with\\nlittle thought - this simple pause really helps your next task be intentional\\nand not dictated by your environment.\"\n  :name \"absorbing-and-professing.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 7467\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1623390272\n                                 1617065396]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/mind/behavior-change.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Behavior Change\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Mind\\\"}\\n---\\n# Behavior Change\\n\\nBuilding new habits is really important to making permanent improvement to your\\nlife.

One useful tool to avoid this is by constraining\\nyour problem space, sometimes dramatically.  For instance, what if you could\\nonly fold the page and do nothing else?  Suddenly, it's much easier (for me at\\nleast) to start just doing something. This helps a lot with \\\"Just Getting\\nStarted\\\".\\n\\nConstraining the problem space could also involve setting a hard deadline for\\nfinishing X in 30-60mins.  This will often introduce an urgency that can help\\nproduce something.\\n\\nAnother idea along these lines is to intentionally try to come up with the\\ndumbest solution/idea and start implementing it. Since you are intentionally\\ntrying to do a bad job, all the thinking and anxiety that comes when trying to\\ndo stuff right is removed, which may facilitate doing something which can later\\nbe polished.\\n\\n## Just Getting Started\\n\\nOnce you get on the path of creation, the small choices you encounter will\\ngenerally be much more manageable decisions, and through them something complex\\noften emerges.\\n\\n## Remixing\\n\\nOur minds create new things by mixing the old together.  A classic examination\\nof this is [Everything is a\\nRemix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc).\\n\\nA corollary of this idea is that to be creative it's helpful to expose yourself\\nto many other ideas.  In my opinion, art in any form is spectacularly useful\\nhere. One way to think about art is as an expression of (hopefully new) ideas\\nspecifically designed to appeal to human sensibilities - the perfect coupling\\nof novelty with a mechanism to get it to stick in your head. Art is also great\\nat encouraging engagement with the world, especially new parts of it.\\n\\n## Vision and Confidence\\n\\nBeing \\\"Determinant\\\" as described by Peter Thiel in [You Are Not a\\nLottery Ticket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZM_JmZdqCw) may help with this.\\n\\n### Being Unreasonable\\n\\nOne (unpolished) thought I've had is that being \\\"unreasonable\\\" could help with\\ncreativity. By unreasonable, I mean **not** considering all possibilities,\\nignoring objectively better optimizations, and ignoring people's good opinions\\nwhen in the process of creating. I've found for myself that, although this\\nconsideration in theory makes for a better end result, it can fracture the\\nstrong focus on a vision that is required to make something at all. Or it can\\nwarp the vision into something that is \\\"better\\\", but actually different to the\\npoint where the original vision is unfulfilled in some way.\\n\\n\\n## See Also\\n\\n - [My thoughts on game development]({{\u003c relref\\n   \\\"/docs/gaming/gamedev/gamedev-context.md\\\" \u003e}}), which play with a lot of these\\n   ideas.\\n - [Cool test](https://www.datcreativity.com/)\\n - [Guided idea generation tool](https://old.tjcx.me/tools/idea-generator.html)\\n - [My thoughts on copyright/ip]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/understanding-the-world/copyright-and-ip.md\\\" \u003e}})\"\n  :name \"creativity.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/gaming/gamedev/gamedev-context.md\"\n          \"/docs/understanding-the-world/copyright-and-ip.md\"]\n  :size 3246\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755995343\n                                 1755449404\n                                 1755322345\n                                 1684902342\n                                 1657997776\n                                 1656388528\n                                 1655691154\n                                 1655659991\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1651276893\n                                 1648526444\n                                 1647920813\n                                 1633626892\n                                 1632246004\n                                 1628313528\n                                 1626378938\n                                 1625947021\n                                 1625939465\n                                 1625939328\n                                 1624337751]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/mind/desires-and-deprivation.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Desires And Deprivation\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Mind\\\"}\\n---\\n# Desires and Deprivation\\n\\nSometimes acting on desires can have negative consequences. For example:\\n\\n - Eating unhealthy food\\n - Stealing money\\n - Falling into an addiction\\n\\nOne way to avoid acting on desires is via _willful deprivation_, or consciously\\nusing willpower to force oneself to not act on the desire. This crucially\\nassumes that the desire is immutable, and focusing solely on resisting it.\\n\\nAn alternative strategy is to question and try to change the desire itself.\\nMany desires exist because of supporting beliefs. For example:\\n\\n - Unhealthy food makes me happier (via taste) than healthy food.\\n - Money will make me happier.\\n - My addictive behavior is healthy and makes me happy.\\n\\nBy poking and prodding at these underlying beliefs, I've personally found that\\nmy desires are more mutable than I originally thought.  Instead of putting\\nenergy into the hard and failure-prone work of relying on willpower to live a\\nbetter life, I have tried to instead put more energy into changing my desires\\nvia new beliefs.

If\\nsystems independently let students test out of courses, or offered testing\\nseparately from training, this problem might be solved to some extent.  Of\\ncourse, in this case the testing would have to be very good, and some things\\nare unfortunately hard to test for.  Project-based evaluation might be a good\\nway around this.\\n\\nSee https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/cs-degree/ for a great story about what a\\ntest-driven education could look like for a motivated individual.\\n\\n## High School as Survey\\n\\nIn my opinion, (at least my) high school education focused too much on\\nfulfilling prerequisites and teaching fundamental topics and too little on\\nsurveying possible areas of study and career paths. I believe this is due to\\nthe assumption that prerequisites are necessary for students to be able to\\nstudy higher level concepts (e.g. algebra before calculus before physics).\\nWhile this is strictly speaking true, it ignores the power of motivating\\ncontext.  By this I mean that if you want to learn how a ball moves through\\nspace in physics, it is very obvious how calculus is helpful towards achieving\\nyour goal.  However, if you are just learning calculus (or algebra!) without\\nthis context, it can feel like what you are learning is pointless (because it\\nis to you at that moment).\\n\\nTrying to learn complex topics without understanding why they are useful is\\nextremely difficult and leads to less memory retention of the things you\\nlearned if you end up do learning them. IMO this is one of the primary reason\\nmany people struggle in school. Conversely, if you DO have a strong reason to\\nlearn something, it is much easier to do so, and you may be able to pack much\\nmore learning into a shorter period of time.  Plus, the learning will be more\\nuseful, as it is already shown to have at least the one motivating use.\\n\\nNot only can focus on hierarchical prerequisites stifle learning rate, it also\\ndoes a disservice to students who are trying to figure out what to specialize\\nin at college (if they attend) and in their careers. I personally knew a lot of\\nabstract concepts in high school, and knew I was interested in STEM, but had\\npretty much no conception of the different types of STEM careers available to\\nme and what kinds of day-to-day work they each would entail. If half the time\\nspent in high school on academic classes was instead spent on career/field\\nsurvey talks/activities/classes, I would have been much better prepared to set\\nmyself up for a fulfilling life after graduation, and I would have been more\\nmotivated to independently study those careers/fields.\\n\\nAs it stands, I feel like I got extremely lucky to land in the jobs I did.  I\\nvery nearly joined a PhD program after college that in retrospect I'm quite\\ncertain I would have liked less than the companies I randomly was exposed to in\\nmy last years in college. It scares me that the only thing that saved me from\\nthis misstep was a random email on a mailing list I randomly joined, as opposed\\nto something built into the educational system.\\n\\n## Extended Education Concept\\n\\nIn high school and college I often felt extremely mentally busy. I was usually\\nin 5+ hours a day of classes teaching radically different things. Synthesizing\\nand remembering everything I was taught was difficult, and I fear that many of\\nthose hours were wasted simply because I didn't have the mental bandwidth to\\nget all the information to stick.\\n\\nPost-college, I feel like I have much more mental bandwidth for learning.  I'm\\nwell able to fill this with books, podcasts, and other online resources.\\nDespite this, I sometimes wonder if generally speaking formal education could\\ndo a better job of utilizing mental bandwidth over time.

Doing hard tasks requires\\nlearning.\\n\\nhttp://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/\\n\\nOne way to model a task is as a tree of possibilities, where each node is a\\ndecision with any number of possible outcomes. Here I'll discuss tasks that are\\nhand because this tree is complex (has many nodes). Tasks can be hard for other\\nreasons (e.g. physically hard), but I wont discuss those here.\\n\\nTask trees can have many nodes because:\\n\\n1. There simply are many steps to take to complete the task,\\n1. Because some steps in the process are committing, making it so that you need\\n   to try to predict a lot of the future decisions that will come up in order to\\n   be confident in your decision (like playing a game of chess),\\n\\n\\n## What Makes Tasks Easy?\\n\\nTasks are easy when a pathway has already been constructed in your head to\\nexecute that task effectively (traverse the tree of decisions in a\\npredetermined way).\\n\\nIt's good to be cautious of tasks that you find to be easy.  In my experience\\nit's a human tendency to strongly defend the solutions to the tasks that one\\nholds (see [a reddit post about political\\nbeliefs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/iu865f/oc_i_did_some_presidential_economic_statistics_to/g5k93df/)\\nand Claire's old lab's observation that ideas/theories can become \\\"precious\\\"\\nonce created).  This makes sense, since it takes effort/time/resources to\\ncreate a task-solving pathway.  See also David Eagleman's neuroscience books,\\nwhich talk about this.  However, this strong defense can blind one to obvious\\nflaws or much better pathways.  It's probably a good habit to occasionally\\nre-learn from scratch originally hard tasks that are important to do well.\\n\\n\\n## Hard Task Solving Strategies - How to Learn\\n\\nLearning requires active exploration of the real world task tree for the task\\nyou want to learn to do.  Through this exploration, the tree is transcribed\\nfrom the real world into mental pathways.  So one way to think about learning\\nhard tasks is learning how to most efficiently explore/transcribe the task\\ntree.\\n\\n\\n### Questions\\n\\nSome parts of the task tree may already exist in your brain from another task\\nyou've done - for example, most of the muscle movement mental pathways needed\\nto run already exist in someone who knows how to walk.  Other parts may be\\ncompletely new, or even contradictory to existing mental pathways.  A very\\nefficient way to more quickly learn these alien pathways is to question them\\nvia:\\n\\n - Asking a task expert\\n - Asking a reference (e.g. A book or Google search)\\n - Tinkering with the task space (e.g. Attempting to run some computer code)\\n\\n\\n### Environmental Influence\\n\\nThe human brain constantly absorbs new information from its perspective on the\\nenvironment where it is.\\nFor learning therefore, it can be helpful to place oneself in an environment\\nconducive to learning what you want to learn.  This usually makes it more\\nobvious what questions to ask to further map out the task space.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/HammockDrivenDev.md\\n\\nhttps://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/what-work-looks-like/\\n\\n\\n### Depth First Search of Task Tree\\n\\nPerhaps a preference of iNtuitive Myers-Briggs personalities, this can lead to\\nfast good solutions, but also blindness to obvious other paths.\\n\\n\\n### Breath First Search of Task Tree\\n\\nPerhaps a habit of Sensing Myers-Briggs personalities, this can lead to good\\nscoping of the task space, but may exhaust energy to \\\"go deep\\\" on a specific\\ntask solution.\\n\\nI think this is what Nassim Taleb advocates for doing more in complex task\\nspace.  He writes that exposing oneself to many decision points and giving\\noneself the option to travel will long term find one the most success.\\n\\n\\n### Mental Perspective\\n\\nThe brain only understands the world as it perceives it through the senses.\\nAlthough the senses can take in a high volume of information, there is still\\nheavy processing that must be done for this information to be useful/actionable\\nby the rest of the brain.  There are many points along this chain of processing\\nwhere learned perspective shapes what the rest of the brain sees.  For instance,\\nan image of an engine may just look like metal to an untrained brain, but tells\\na very different story to a mechanic.\\n\\nIn a way, learning or training is partially (or completely?) the process of\\nacquiring new perspectives from which to see the world.  This explains why\\nlearning can be such a \\\"stop and go\\\" process - it's easy to be stuck on a\\nconcept for a while before it finally clicks.\\n\\n- [Inversion by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/inversion)\\n  - Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to\\n    succeed.\"\n  :name \"how-to-do-hard-tasks.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/mind/motivation.md\"]\n  :size 5091\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755322345\n                                 1667066083\n                                 1655691154\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1651956280\n                                 1637430676]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/mind/influences.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Influences\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Mind\\\"}\\n---\\n# Influences\\n\\nThese works have guided my thinking about how the mind works.

is wrong!\\n\\nI don't think that intelligence is a useful concept, and don't think that some\\nkind of \\\"general intelligence\\\" (e.g. IQ) even exists in the way it's commonly\\ninvoked (e.g. \\\"Alex is more intelligent than Tom\\\").\\n\\nMy main critique is that the human brain is _very_ context/domain specific in\\nit's ability.\\nA good analogy is athleticism.\\nSumo wrestlers, sprinters, archers, and football players can all be considered\\n\\\"athletic\\\", but their talents are all scoped very narrowly to their respective\\nsports.\\nI would argue that the brain is like this, but x100.\\nWould a talented typist be considered more \\\"intelligent\\\" than someone good at\\nsolving sudoku puzzles?\\nIs someone good at solving the problems posed in IQ tests more \\\"intelligent\\\"\\nthan a creative scientist?\\nTrying to make these comparisons is, in my opinion, silly.\\n\\nOne interesting thought is that maybe intelligence can be defined as the ease at\\nwhich new skills can be learned?\\nI would argue that this is also very domain specific.\\nAlso this would imply that newborn infants are very intelligent, which runs\\ncounter to our intuitions about the word.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe intelligence is the number of skills one is proficient in?\\nThis seems more reasonable, but still has major flaws.\\nFor one, how would difficulty of skills be considered, if at all?\\n\\nSome skills, like \\\"reasoning\\\", \\\"deduction\\\", or \\\"argument\\\" seem like they should\\nbe proxies for intelligence.\\nI think skills like this can be learned like many others, and are built by\\netching heuristics and patterns into your brain.\\n\\nRelevant note: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38509399\"\n  :name \"intelligence.md\"\n

#{\\\"Mind\\\"}\\n---\\n# Motivation\\n\\nNOTE This is a random theory of mine; don't put too much stock into it!\\n\\nMotivation to do something requires that the \\\"something\\\" is **attainable** and\\n**meaningful** (has a point/purpose).\\n\\n## (Perceived) Attainability\\n\\nObjectives that are *perceived* - which is really all that matters with respect\\nto motivation - to be attainable have a trivially easy to accomplish next step\\non the path toward them.\\n\\nWhat makes a next step trivially easy?\\nIf your body/mind are primed to do the task such that you could do it with\\nminimal/no conscious intervention.\\nFor example walking, reading, or doing some trained skill are trivially easy.\\nNote that this depends on the current state of your body; walking may not be\\ntrivially easy if you are exhausted or have a broken leg.\\nAnd also the state of your mind; responding to a conversation may be hard if you\\nhaven't caught up on what has been said.\\n\\nNote that the whole path to the objective does not have to be trivially easy or\\neven known.\\nAll that matters where motivation is concerned is the next step (at least for\\nattainability).\\n\\nMotivation can flag when the next step towards a goal is unclear.\\nIn such situations it's easy to simply switch gears to another activity which\\nhas clear steps - this is procrastination.\\n\\n### How to make things attainable\\n\\nWhen something feels unattainable because either (a) it seems so hard you would\\nfail if you tried or (b) its unclear what step to take next, I have found\\nseveral tricks that work pretty well:\\n\\n#### Thinking Creatively\\n\\nSee [thoughts on creativity]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/mind/creativity.md\\\" \u003e}}).\\n\\n#### Taking a Step Back\\n\\nTaking a step back both from the problem at hand AND from anything else that\\nengages your mind.\\nThe goal here is to put yourself in a state of boredom, then slightly nudge your\\nthoughts toward your issue.\\nOften I find my mind much more eagerly thinks about something when the prospect\\nof boredom is there as an alternative.\\nOne way to do this is by going and sitting in another chair far from\\ndistractions.\\n\\nAnother alternative is going for a walk or run, preferably with no audio or\\nother distractions.\\nThis method also usually engages my creativity, which helps open up new\\npotential paths to issue resolution.\\nThere is the drawback that sometimes here my creativity will wander, and I will\\nend up with good ideas about something other than my issue.\\n\\n#### Talking it Out\\n\\nTalk to someone (or yourself) about the issue.\\nSometimes the act of putting your issue into works can snap some clarity into\\nit.\\nThe person you are talking to may also offer useful insights.\\nWriting thoughts down can also sometimes work here, if no-one is available to\\ntalk to.\\n\\nThis usually involves re-verifying the assumptions you've been making about the\\nproblem.\\n\\n#### Getting Psyched Up\\n\\nThis only applies when you find the task hard, but you see the path you would\\ntake to do it.\\nIn this case, for me listening to energetic music or putting myself in an\\nenergetic, stimulating, or even stressful environment (e.g. with other people\\naround) can help me feel more active and therefore more able to do my hard task.\\nI think part of this is that the stimulation occupies the higher level part of\\nmy mind that's telling me the task is hard, and just lets the less conscious\\nparts of me simply execute.\\nAgain, this only works for a case (a) above, **not** when it's unclear what to\\ndo next.\\nSee the book \\\"Antifragile\\\" for more on this, specifically Book 1 Chapter 2.\\n\\n#### Making Concrete Sub-Tasks\\n\\nOne highly effective way to keep something consistently attainable is to break\\nit into smaller, concrete pieces that are each attainable even to a tired or\\ndistracted mind.\\nThe actual act of doing this can be very difficult, so this isn't a great\\nsolution when you are already finding your motivation flagging.\\nThis strategy shines when you let your past self do this for you when it is\\nenergized and fresh.\\nOf course, your past self wont have the direct motivation to do this (as it's\\ndoing fine) so it helps to set reminders for yourself to do this work when you\\nare fresh.\\n\\n#### TODO add a reference to the manifesto \\\"vision\\\" section here, or merge the sections\\n\\n### How to make things LESS attainable\\n\\nWhen stuck on attainability, there are several counterproductive strategies:\\n\\n**Eating food** in hopes that it will give you energy to push through.\\nThis always just makes me MORE tired especially in the short term.\\nPlus I usually feel more able/energetic when I am slightly hungry.\\n\\n**Trying to brute force** your way through an issue without trying alternate\\nroutes.\\nThis sometimes works, but usually just makes me feel stupid and can lead to a\\nvicious cycle where I continually burn more and more energy in less and less\\nwell directed ways trying to prove I am not stupid :).\\nThe key to avoiding this is making sure you aren't following the same lines of\\nthought over and over, and stopping if you find yourself doing so.\\n\\nThe tendency to try to brute force I find is more and more temping the most\\ntired you are.\\nOne way to explain this is that as you do something hard (that you don't already\\nhave mental circuits to handle) , your mind contracts/focuses on the problem\\nuntil it becomes so rigid that even the slightest unexpected event (or new\\nsolution idea) is hard to handle.\\nThis is counter to an \\\"expanded\\\" mind where many possibilities are open and easy\\nto handle.\\nIf you have been focusing hard on one thing, a way to expand your mind is to do\\nsomething you might find boring and let your mind wander its way to expansion.\\nAs discussed earlier, going for a walk or otherwise exercising I find hastens\\nthis process.\\nSo going for a walk with no stimulation (no reading on phone, no listening to\\nanything, no conversations with people) is a great technique.\\nSome of this is inspired by the last part of Chapter 5 of \\\"How to Change Your\\nMind\\\" by Michael Pollan.\\n\\n\\n## (Perceived) Meaning\\n\\nI find that discussing things with other people, **especially** if those other\\npeople care about those things (want them to happen), imbues a lot of meaning to\\nthem.\\n\\nActivities are also meaningful when they fit neatly into a larger narrative.\\nThis could be a grand narrative about one's identity (e.g. defined by what\\n[virtues you aspire to or\\npossess](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths)), or a myopic\\nnarrative about what puzzle piece should fit next into the puzzle to bring it\\ncloser to solution.\\n\\nWhat you or others may find meaningful in a certain situation varies a lot for\\nmany reasons.\\nI have found myself obsessed with completing certain goals, and then having my\\nobsession and motivation completely evaporate after reframing the larger context\\nthose goals fit into.\\n\\nOne way to lose motivation for a task is to follow the meaning of the task up\\nthrough all the ways it impacts the world, coming to the final conclusion that\\nthere is no greater meaning in the world (or you don't know what it is), and\\ntherefore the task itself is meaningless.\\nThis kind of \\\"bubbling up\\\" can happen on a smaller scale as well.\\n\\nTODO explore ideas from\\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-learn-faster-when-we-arent-told-what-choices-to-make/\\n\\nThere are many sources of meaning (just see the above linked virtues list). Some\\nof the sources that are strong for me personally:\\n\\n1. Making something complicated, or hard to think about, clear.\\n   This could mean writing a good description or coming up with a good\\n   diagram/model.\\n   For example: https://ciechanow.ski/gps/.\\n    - One of the main reasons this is so important is that it breeds motivation\\n      for you and others to work on the complicated thing.\\n1. Building a tool that makes a task someone does regularly much easier.\\n   Doesn't matter how well the tool is built, just that it works.\\n1. Proving competence.\\n   This involves demonstrating to myself and others that I can overcome\\n   difficult challenges.\\n   What the challenge actually is isn't really that important, only that I can\\n   succeed at it where others (including my past self) fail.\\n\\n\\n## Holding loosely and Ego\\n\\nBecoming highly personally invested in a task often surfaces a lot of paralyzing\\nemotions like fear of failure.\\nEven for work that could be life-changing, I find \\\"holding loosely\\\" or not\\ncaring too much about the outcome is a highly effective strategy.\\nThis frees your mind up to perform in the moment, which will often be what\\ndetermines the ultimate result of the work.\\n\\nThis mindset avoids the problem of focusing on things not in your control\\n(explored in [this gamedev post about\\nSNKRX](https://www.a327ex.com/posts/snkrx_log/#control)).\\nBy definition, this thinking can't directly lead to positive action that would\\nimprove your situation.\\nThe best it can do is _maybe_ make you stumble upon some new information if you\\nare doing research about the thing not in your control, but much more often I\\nfind that it leads to dead-end thoughts that make you lose motivation entirely.\\n\\nI found this concept to be extremely helpful when interviewing for jobs.\\nHere this is particularly relevant because interviewing involves being social\\nwith your interviewer, and having a positive social interaction usually requires\\nsharing positive emotions.\\nIt's much easier to do this if you are actually feeling these emotions, and not\\nfaking them while internally feeling fear or panic.\\n\\nThis concept is really helpful in sports too, or anything that requires high\\nin-the-moment performance.\\nIn fact, I was first introduced to this concept when playing tennis.\\nI was taught to hold my racket like a tube of toothpaste - if I squeezed too\\nhard (get too tense), the toothpaste would come out.\\nThis relaxed physical state is tightly coupled to a relaxed mental state of\\nbeing \\\"in the moment\\\".\\n\\nOne great exploration of this is the concept of \\\"effortless effort\\\" in Zen\\nphilosophy.\\nI was first introduced to this by the book [Zen in the Martial Arts by Joe\\nHyams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424340.Zen_in_the_Martial_Arts).\\nThere are also some good thoughts about this in [Zen Mind, Beginners Mind by\\nShunryu Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Mind,_Beginner%27s_Mind).\\n\\nSee [my thoughts on creativity]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/mind/creativity.md\\\" \u003e}}) for\\nmore exploration of related ideas.\\n\\n## Expectations\\n\\nFor me, the hardest part of executing on goals is getting my entire brain on\\nboard to apply effort towards my current goal.\\nThe best way I've found to do this so far is by keeping the quality of the final\\nproduct out of my head.\\nIn other words, I try to not have expectations for a specific result or, if\\nthat's too hard, I at least try to keep my expectations low.\\n\\nNot worrying about my goal's final product makes it much easier to just start\\ndoing something.\\nMy ego is protected from failure, and I can utilize all the parts of my brain\\nthat live in the moment.\\nUsually, the best final products are honed as they are made anyway - attempting\\nto plan out the perfect product from the start without getting feedback from the\\nwork often just leads me to a state of analysis paralysis.\\n\\nThe expectations of others are often even more extreme of a factor than my own\\nexpectations.\\nFor example, if I am given a task (or collaboratively come up with a task) that\\nis perceived as very difficult or impossible, any progress at all will make me\\nextremely motivated to continue.\\nConversely, if a task is seen as trivial to accomplish, I may not be motivated\\nto start right away or, worse, I will feel very stressed if it ends up taking\\nlonger than expected.\\n\\n## Managing Excitement\\n\\nTODO maybe find a better place for this.\\n\\nOne common pattern I fall into is getting really into one particular activity\\nfor a while, exploring it thoroughly, then getting tired of it and loosing\\nmotivation to explore further.\\nIn this situation, what can help is breaking the exploration off to keep the\\nexcitement going in the next session (having a sense of anticipation for the\\nnext session).\\n\\n## Execution\\n\\nSome great resources for goal execution:\\n\\n -

even involuntary reactions - or even\\nemotions or like things like pain.\\nEven if you don't actually have real nerve pain if your perspective of the world\\nmakes you think that you should be feeling it you probably will (see [rubber\\nhand experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk)).\\nThis is kind of like in The Matrix when if people die in The Matrix they die in\\nreal life because their perspective is so holy fused with their Matrix selves.\\nI'm not sure if that's how it would work in real life but I think that's closer\\nthan you might otherwise think to the real world.\\n\\n\\n## Learning\\n\\nLearning about something - understanding some concept - is really just\\nincorporating the perspective of it into your mental model.\\nSo for instance if you want to learn history or math or something like that all\\nit takes is for you to shape your mind so that you see the problem or the\\nhistorical event or whatever you see it directly from your perspective.\\n\\nI think with things like math this is incredibly insightful.\\nFor me often math or logic problems are very hard to understand at first.\\nEven memorization of the answer often doesn't help with understanding and later\\nreproduction.\\nHowever at some point the problems just click into place and it becomes second\\nnature to deploy that new logical rule or whatever in problem solving.\\nI think that's because at that point you see the problem from your perspective\\nor it becomes a perspective that you have.\\nTreating these problems in that way can help reduce the stress associated with\\ntrying to learn them and maybe help hasten the learning process.\\n\\n## Self Deception \\n\\nBecause there are many valid perspectives given the same set of sensory inputs\\nif you choose to even ignore some of those inputs or twist things it's very easy\\nto put yourself in a state where your model of the world is very different from\\nthat of most others.\\nSome might say this means you are deluded or even being self deceptive if you\\nconsciously choose to ignore new inputs.\\nI think being in this state of mind is very dangerous when making real decisions\\nthat impact people's lives.\\nMoreover, this state of mind can be very easy to fall into.\\nHowever, if your goal is to explore new ideas or discover new things, adopting\\nthis mindset may be necessary to some extent in order to put yourself in a place\\nthat allows you to do that.\\nSo I do think there's a perilous pro and con trade-off situation to be in this\\nself deceiving state.\\nI do think self deception can be very positively helpful when it comes to\\nmotivation.\\nIn Peter Thiel's talk about luck ([You Are Not a Lottery\\nTicket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZM_JmZdqCw)) he mentions that even if\\nluck exists it may be valuable to ignore that fact, self-deceiving yourself,\\nbecause if you do then the ways in which you act will produce better outcomes\\nthan if you just assume some things are not in your control.\\n\\nSelf deception is really tricky when it comes to being a scientist or doing some\\nkind of scientific pursuit, because on the one hand putting yourself in a new\\nperspective that is flawed or incorrect enables you to do the experiments and\\ntry to reason through whether the perspective is actually true or not.\\nHowever by putting yourself there it can be dangerous because if you are too\\ndeep in your perspective then you can start to bias your experiments and\\notherwise just come up with erroneous results.\\nI do think it's important though that some people do put themselves in those\\ndangerous position when it comes to innovation and I don't think they should be\\nlike a vilified or thrown out as non-scientific or something like that.\\nI think their perspectives are important it's just important to realize that\\nthey are in a new place which is probably mostly incorrect without just writing\\nthem off completely because I think there's a lot of value that can be gained\\nfrom people in this periphery.\\n\\n## Inspirations\\n\\nI wrote down these ideas after listening to Peter Attia's discussion on Esther\\nPerel about like an hour or so into the podcast (1:20).\"\n  :name \"perspective.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 4885\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1659551821\n                                 1659551685\n                                 1658277343\n                                 1657997776]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/mind/pressure-and-integrity.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Pressure And Integrity\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Mind\\\"}\\n---\\n# Pressure and Integrity\\n\\nWhen people end up stressed or under pressure, they will more often \\\"cheat\\\" or\\notherwise violate their integrity.\\nTo assume otherwise is IMO naively optimistic.\\n\\nInstead of telling yourself that you have principles you will never violate, it\\nmay be better to focus your energy on recognizing what causes stress/pressure so\\nthat you can avoid or otherwise manage it.\\nThis IMO is a more realistic way to uphold integrity.\\n\\n## Anecdotes\\n\\nSome anecdotes that illustrate this thought:\\n\\n -

Everyone involved must take their\\nmodels out of their heads so that others can amend their own models in an\\neffort to reach some kind of consensus.  This is hard work and is not always\\ntreated as such.\\n\\nNot only is it hard work to do this model-sharing, but it can create [cognitive\\ndissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), which causes\\npain.  This can necessitate further model-sharing to resolve, which can balloon\\na small issue into a massive ordeal.  I like this quote from Valarie Kaur:\\n\\n   \\\"Deep listening is an act of surrender. We risk being changed by what we hear.\\\"\\n\\nTo expect people to readily do this is in my opinion expecting too much.  Of\\ncourse, putting effort into this process is necessary for many types of work;\\nlots of problems arise when someone is not willing to *ever* do this.\\n\\nThis article does a good job of providing a methodology for resolving friction\\naround model-sharing:\\n\\nhttps://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-resolve-a-conflict-when-both-sides-are-right-1f375bc82f7f\\n\\n\\n## Emotional Consensus and Disagreement {#emotional-conversations}\\n\\nPeople are very sensitive to emotions of others (accurately understood or not)\\nin conversations. This is especially true of negative emotions. Because of\\nthis, it can very easily become the goal of a conversation to help resolve\\nnegative emotions present in your conversation partner. This can be good, but\\ncan also be a problem if your are mis-reading your partner's emotions or if\\nthey don't want those emotions resolved. I think it's good to be aware of this\\ntendency and catch yourself if you see issues arising because of it.\\n\\nRelated, one thing I've noticed that sparks involved discussions (or heated\\narguments) is lack of **emotional** consensus on a topic. I've had several\\ntalks where it seems like I agree with my conversation partner, but there is\\nstill an unresolved tension in the air. This tension existed because, although\\nwe clarified facts, we still had different emotional reactions to the topic,\\nimplying that we hadn't created a fully shared perspective. Identifying that\\nthis is the root cause of the tension can be a good way to get to the bottom of\\nthe disagreement.\\n\\n\\n## Pitfalls in Productive Conversations\\n\\nIf we say a \\\"productive conversation\\\" is one where people are trying to find\\nconsensus on a particular question, there are a couple patterns that can make\\nthese conversations take much more time and energy to achieving their goal:\\n\\n### Having unclear definitions\\n\\nIt can sometimes be easy for a lot of conversation to happen before the\\nparticipants realize that the definitions they are assuming are not the same\\nfor the relevant terms/concepts. It's usually worth the time to get core\\ndefinitions really nailed down before moving past them into what effects they\\nhave on other concepts.\\n\\n### Exploding the Scope\\n\\nOften conversations lead to tangents that might be even more interesting to\\nsome participants than the original conversation. Being explicit about when\\none is making a jump to discussing a tangent can be really helpful for several\\nreasons:\\n\\n1. The other participants may not care about the tangent.\\n1. The other participants may feel like the tangent-follower is assuming that\\n   they believe something about the tangent based on the previous conversation,\\n   when that's actually not true. \\n\\nA common reason for following a tangent is when trying to argue for a\\nparticular viewpoint, and not finding a good path forward with the current\\nargument. For instance, take an example where one is arguing why book X is\\nbetter than a similar book Y.  They might start by describing why they think\\nthe main character is more relatable, but then shift into talking about the\\nworld being more fleshed out when they run out of points. This can be jarring\\nif the other participants are still thinking about character-relatableness, and\\nfeel like the tangent-follower is just glossing over their own points. Worst\\ncase, the tangent follower can to this intentionally to confuse their\\n\\\"opponents\\\" to \\\"win\\\" a debate.\\n\\n\\n## [Reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology))\\n\\nPeople inherently like to be in control of what happens to them in their lives.\\nWhen this control is threatened, resistance to the threat is the natural\\nresponse. I definitely have felt this when in a situation where someone tells\\nme to do something - even something I know I want to do. The very fact that I\\nwas told to do it makes me _less_ interested in doing it! Sometimes this effect\\ncan be extreme.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons why micromanagement of others leads to all sorts of\\nproblems. It is much more motivating to let people come to their own decisions\\nabout whether to do something if possible. \\n\\nIn my experience, learning is also easier when the topic of study is not\\ndictated to me, but instead I explore it \\\"freely\\\". Even reading a linear\\ntextbook can feel free (and I absorb the information better) when I set the\\npace and am able to jump around at will.\\n\\n### Circumventing Reactance\\n\\nSometimes you still need to tell people what to do to effectively get things\\ndone. For cases where reactance is strong, creating an environment in which a\\nperson can explore and independently come to your conclusion for what needs to\\nbe done may be an effective strategy. This has the added benefit (?) of\\nallowing them to come to an even better conclusion than your own!\\n\\n\\n## Assuming Good Intentions\\n\\nIt's pretty hard sometimes to figure out why someone is doing something in\\nparticular.  [This clip from Malcolm in the Middle about changing a light\\nbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0) is a pretty funny extreme\\nexample, but I find this kind of situation comes up in smaller ways fairly\\noften. If you must have expectations for someone doing something for you (which\\nare best avoided entirely), it's good to keep in mind that their approach is\\nprobably going to be different from yours in ways that are hard to predict.\\nTrying to figure it out - or worse, micromanage them - may often be wasted\\neffort and lead to interpersonal frustration.\\n\\n\\n## Complaining\\n\\nPeople complain for at least two main reasons:\\n\\n1. They need help with something.  Either via:\\n    1. Direct help (offloading their problem in part to someone else).\\n    1. Advice help (having another person help improve their understanding of\\n       their problem, so that they can solve it alone without transferring any\\n       responsibility).\\n    1. In \\\"How to Change your Mind\\\" by Michael Pollan this was described as a\\n       \\\"doing\\\" behavior.\\n1. They want to share their feelings so that others around them are on the same\\n   page about their emotional state.  This is helpful e.g. so others around\\n   them will not burden them further, unaware of their current burden.  This is\\n   also helpful for emotional validation reasons - it is useful to know if the\\n   thing you are upset about upsets others; if not, perhaps you are missing an\\n   easy resolution to your problem.\\n    1. In \\\"How to Change your Mind\\\" by Michael Pollan this was described as a\\n       \\\"being\\\" (in the moment) behavior.\\n\\nIt is easy (at least for me) to jump strait to advice help when people complain\\naround me and ignore the fact that the complainer may need one of the other\\ntypes of resolution described above.\"\n  :name \"working-with-others.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 7487\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1631562802\n                                 1630356900\n                                 1629525691\n                                 1629339786\n                                 1628632251\n                                 1628225587\n                                 1627319610]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Morality\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/morality/altruism.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Altruism\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Morality\\\"}\\n---\\n# Altruism\\n\\n - Good examination of effective altruism: https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/\"\n  :name \"altruism.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Morality\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 145\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1654406756]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Morality\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/morality/cancelling-high-contributors.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Cancelling High Contributors\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Morality\\\"}\\n---\\n# Cancelling Highly Productive People\\n\\nUnfortunately, it seems like some highly productive people that have\\npermanently improved the lives of millions of people are also either not very\\nsocially aware and/or are downright abusive to their colleagues.

Could very well have\\nlarge holes in it, but currently has a large influence on how I make decisions.\\n\\n## Assumption 1: Our goal is to maximize positive emotions.\\n\\nOur goal is to maximize the amount of time people feel positive emotions:\\n\\n - happiness\\n - fulfillment\\n - satisfaction\\n - empowerment\\n - energy\\n\\nAnd minimize the time spent feeling negative emotions:\\n\\n - pain\\n - depression\\n - apathy\\n\\nSince this is our goal, I'll define a \\\"moral\\\" act as an act that helps further\\nthis goal.\\n\\n\\n## Assumption 2: Emotions are personal reactions to experiences.\\n\\nEmotions arise when an experience is having positive or negative effects on\\nyou or people/things you care about (as far as you perceive it). \\n\\nEmotions are **not** intrinsically tied to specific experiences. For instance,\\ndepending on the person and their context, the experience of swimming can\\ninduce a wide variety of emotions:\\n\\n - fear\\n - exhaustion\\n - empowerment\\n - adventure\\n - relaxation\\n\\nThese same emotions can be induced by a wide variety of other experiences.  **No\\nexperience has a \\\"monopoly\\\" on specific emotions**, except for very low level\\ndrives (like eating satisfying hunger, drinking satisfying thirst, etc).\\n\\n\\n## Assumption 3: Experience-having requires resource destruction (cost), which often has negative emotional cost.\\n\\nMost experiences require some destruction of resources to have. All experiences\\nrequire the experiencer's time at the very least, but many also require:\\n\\n1. The work of other people.\\n1. A share of a finite resource.\\n\\nIn our society, we use money as a proxy for these resources, and spend that\\nmoney on experiences, quantifying this exchange. Money that goes unspent can be\\nused to have more personal experiences in the future, given to others so\\nthey can do the same, or used to build a system that makes future\\nexperience-having cheaper. \\n\\n\\n## Assumption 4: There is a lower cost threshold required for good experiences.\\n\\nEveryone needs to eat, drink, and fulfill other basic needs to not suffer large\\namounts of negative emotions (and die). These experiences have a cost, although\\nit can be very low. One outlier is medical care, but the minimum necessary cost\\nof this is controversial.\\n\\n\\n## Assumption 5: Emotional effects of an experience are uncoupled to cost past their lower threshold.\\n\\nPast the lower threshold for basic need type experiences, my observation is\\nthat the emotional effects of experiences are not well correlated to their\\ncost. Rather, they are primarily influenced by the context of that experience\\nin life. Some anecdotes:\\n\\n### Media\\n\\nThe excitement or other emotional reaction to media (books/movies/games) comes\\noften from:\\n\\n - Nostalgia\\n - What media one has consumed in the past\\n - What one's been thinking about recently\\n - What friends are talking about (not necessarily what's new)\\n - Media quality. Luckily the globalization of entertainment means this does\\n   not have a large impact on individual user cost.\\n\\n### Physicality\\n\\nMost physical pleasures are almost entirely dependent on context:\\n\\n - Hunger can make almost any food taste good; fullness can make even the\\n   fanciest desert sickening.\\n - Sleep can be the most important thing in the world, or impossible to do.\\n - Sexual experiences can be amazing, or traumatic.\\n\\n### Novelty\\n\\nTrips to foreign lands or completely new experiences get their excitement from\\nnovelty.\\n\\n### Side Note: Lifestyle Inflation\\n\\nMany experiences get boring over time (they become less emotionally powerful).\\nA common tendency is to try to make them more interesting by dumping more\\nresources into them in an effort to \\\"upgrade\\\" them. This is convenient because\\nit allows one to feel the comfort of familiarly with the experience while\\ngetting the thrill of novelty at the same time.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this can get very expensive and, even worse, can leave one at a\\nnew baseline of cost to uphold the new normal of these experiences. At this\\npoint, trying to downgrade will usually cause negative emotional reaction,\\nwhich is counter to our goal.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion: Living efficiently is morally optimal.\\n\\nI define efficiency as the ratio of maximum positive emotionality achieved to\\nthe cost required to achieve that emotionality. I argue that the best way to\\nmeet our original goal is to maximize the efficiency of our lives. This will\\nallow the greatest number of people to meet their lower threshold experience\\ncosts, and leave resources left over to make it even easier to meet this cost\\ngoing forward.\\n\\nWasteful activities, which are high cost but produce the same emotional return\\nas lower cost activities, are therefore to be avoided as much as possible.\\nTheir cost indirectly takes resources away from places where those resources\\nwould be much more emotionally powerful. This can be extreme; people spend many\\ntimes a basic income requirement on experiences commonly :(.\\n\\n\\n## Practical Consequences\\n\\n### Assumption 6: People have some control over their interests\\n\\nExposure to different people/environments can lead to adoption of a variety of\\ndifferent interests.\\nOld interests can fade if experienced in new light.\\n\\nI don't believe that a particular person's passions are out in the world, are\\nimmutable, and just require discovery.\\n\\nThis means that people are not necessarily trapped in inefficient (and therefore\\nimmoral) interests.\\n\\n### What would I choose?\\n\\nOne practical way to engage with this line of thinking is to try the following\\ncreative thinking exercise.\\nPretend you are creating a person (say yourself) and need to determine what that\\nperson will be interested in or passionate about.\\nWhat would you choose for them?\\nWhy?\\nWhat's stopping you from adopting those interests?\\n\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\nI recently listed to part of Peter Attia's podcast with the author of [\\\"Die with\\nZero\\\"](https://www.diewithzerobook.com/).\\nThe fact that the ideas discussed here don't seem to be discussed in that book\\nled to me have a strong negative emotional reaction to the podcast.\\nIt felt like a hyper rich individual exploring how to live life as inefficiently\\nas possible :/.\"\n  :name \"efficient-living-and-morality.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Morality\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 6188\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1673301100\n                                 1673289798\n                                 1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1642380817]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Morality\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/morality/future.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Future\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Morality\\\"}\\n---\\n# Morality of the Future\\n\\n - Mind Uploading: https://qntm.org/mmacevedo\\n - [Three Worlds Collide](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HawFh7RvDM4RyoJ2d/three-worlds-collide-0-8)\"\n  :name \"future.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Morality\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 227\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1658277343\n                                 1658206871]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Morality\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/morality/right-to-risk.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Right To Risk\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Morality\\\"}\\n---\\n# Right to Risk\\n\\nReading https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity made me think\\nabout how much **personally** dangerous/risky behavior we should legally allow.\\nShould we allow unhealthy eating?

how would you actually achieve a\\nco-op like structure where I'll just say everybody is a co-owner.\\nThere's probably other ways to do it but that makes the most sense or is the\\nsimplest to me.\\nSo everybody owns an equal share of the business and they have equal voting\\nrights.\\n\\nI struggle to understand how this could happen.\\nFor example, let's say I start a software business, write some software, and\\nthen sell it directly to people who pay me for the program and support.\\nLet's say that I run the business by myself and one day want to hire somebody\\nelse to help me with the business.\\nIt seems like what I would have to do is upon hiring of that person I would have\\nto give them a gift of half the company.\\nOr maybe as they work they would grow their half of the company because if I\\njust gave him half the company then in theory they could just sell it and leave\\nand never actually work for me and just take the money.\\nSo maybe they would have to over time work up to it like a vesting schedule.\\n\\nEven then it's it seems kind of strange that the person that you hire has so\\nmuch leverage immediately on the company.\\nMaybe that's not that strange but it feels strange to me especially if you're\\nhiring somebody to do a specific task.\\nFor instance if you needed to pay somebody to just make the graphics for your\\nwebsite and that's it.\\nFor someone hired to do some very specific task that doesn't necessarily involve\\nstrategic direction over the company it seems weird that they would be given a\\nbig part of something that you built.\\nThis would mean people would just have to be very careful about how they hire,\\nwhich would probably slow a company's ability to hire because you're not really\\nhiring somebody you're more like partnering with somebody.\\nEvery single person who joins your organization effectively becomes a partner.\\n\\nThis would make decision making a lot harder because pretty much everything\\nwould have to be voted on.\\nPerhaps there would be representatives like like an internal senate or something\\nwhere representatives would make the decisions for the company's direction and\\nnot every single employee would have to be involved.\\n\\nThe part of this like that's the most unclear to me is like how you could set up\\na structure where when you're hiring your first, your second, or third, fourth,\\nfifth employee how their ownership would manifest.\\nWhat would happen if they leave?\\nAre they forced to sell their shares in the company when they leave or does it\\njust disappear and everybody else gets a bigger slice of the company?\\nOr their voting rights are lost but they still hold their shares?\\n\\nMaybe thinking about the company in terms of shares is part of my confusion.\\nMaybe it shouldn't be thought of that way, although in the end if a majority of\\nthe employees decide to sell the company that should be possible.\\nThen there would be a way for employees to cash out.\\nPerhaps limiting the liquidity of the stock is the way to manage these issues.\\n\\nThis train of thought makes me interested in learning more how current co-ops\\nlike Costco or WinCo or PCC grew.\\nHow did they start?\\nHow do they grow?\\nDoes every employee have an equal voting right who owns them?\"\n  :name \"co-ops.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Society\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 4679\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1656388528\n                                 1656388399]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Society\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/society/communal-living.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Communal Living\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Society\\\"}\\n---\\n# Communal Living\\n\\nIn media like [Everyday Utopia]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/books/everyday-utopia.md\\\"\\n\u003e}}), communal living situations are brought up as a way to help people get a\\nbetter sense of community and lead happier lives.\\nWhy then do many people not live this way?\\n\\nI hear personally anecdotes from people that they \\\"want their own place\\\" or that\\nthey are tired of living with others.\\n\\n... elaborate ...\"\n  :name \"communal-living.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Society\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/books/everyday-utopia.md\"]\n  :size 457\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755322345\n                                 1700078474\n                                 1699041494\n                                 1698384423]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Society\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/society/doom-and-how-to-avoid-it.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Doom And How To Avoid It\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Society\\\"}\\n---\\n# Doom, and how to avoid it\\n\\n## We got problems\\n\\n -

For example:\\n\\n - **Climate Change** could be solved if we all transitioned to using more\\n   renewable sources of energy.\\n - The **Obesity Epidemic** could be solved if we all ate less food.\\n\\n## Individual Change and Shaming\\n\\nOne common proposal I've heard for solving at least the above problems is using\\na \\\"grassroots\\\" approach. This method would involve first changing your own\\nbehavior such that the problem would be solved if everyone behaved like you,\\nthen trying to influence others to adopt your new behavior(s). This seems\\nsimple enough, but I don't think it's the best way forward, and in some ways is\\nactively harmful.\\n\\nThe tacit assumption with this proposal is that people are able to choose what\\nbehaviors to adopt. I would argue that in fact our behaviors are much more\\ninfluenced by our environment than we would like to admit. One component of our\\nenvironment is indeed other people peer pressuring us, but (IMO) far more\\ndominant factors include:\\n\\n - Economics (how much the behavior change costs)\\n - \\\"At hand\\\"-ness (what other behaviors are \\\"at hand\\\" and easy to do)\\n\\nWhen these factors are overpowering (which I argue they usually are), peer\\npressure becomes a form of bullying and social rejection that the target of\\nwhich is powerless to stop. Perpetuating this is downright cruel.\\n\\n## Changing the Environment\\n\\nIf a grassroots behavior change movement isn't the best way to solve the\\nproblem, then what can we do instead?  In my opinion, the answer is\\nenvironmental change. This can take several forms:\\n\\n### 1. Local Environmental Change\\n\\nThis involves making changes to an individual's local environment (the spaces\\nthey interact with on a habitual basis) to guide them to certain behaviors.\\nSome examples would be intentionally not buying unhealthy food when at the\\ngrocery store so that when at home these foods are not \\\"at hand\\\". Or not buying\\na car so that you instead need to bike or bus to get around.\\n\\nNote that the line here can be pretty blurry between what is an actual behavior\\nchange and what is simply an action that changes one's environment. Because of\\nthis, I think the stronger, ultimate solution is:\\n\\n### 2. Policy-Level Environmental Change\\n\\nGovernment policies can create massive environmental changes. For example,\\nextra taxes on certain products can massively impact people's buying decisions.\\nOr bans of certain products can completely change the suite of chemicals that\\nindividuals are exposed to on a daily basis.\\n\\nA natural objection is to point out that in a democracy, the majority of people\\n(in theory) choose what policies are enacted. Because of this, wouldn't people\\njust vote for policies that help them perpetuate their current behavior set -\\nwhich they presumably \\\"chose\\\" and/or otherwise would like to keep?\\n\\nI argue that actually **people are quite able to vote in a way counter to their\\neveryday actions**. For instance, people who enjoy soda may vote for a\\nsugar-sweetened beverage tax. The reason why (I think) this is because the\\nmental state you adopt when voting is generally different that the mental state\\nwhen deciding - or not consciously deciding at all - to engage in a particular\\nbehavior.\\n\\nThis is especially true when voting on higher level, more abstract policies.\\nFor instance, banning a certain type of energy production might indirectly\\nincrease someone's cost of living by quite a bit in various ways, but thinking\\nabout the policy in a more abstract sense may lead someone to approve it\\ndespite this personal impact.\\n\\nBased on my own emotions, I also think that people by and large care deeply\\nabout how their lives compare to those of others around them.  A tax that\\ngreatly increases everyone's cost of living is much more bearable than one that\\ntargets just an individual person. It's much rarer for people to worry about\\ntheir absolute standing than how they compare to others - the fact that the\\nmajority of people today live like the elites of a couple centuries ago is not\\na great source of comfort and satisfaction generally speaking.\\n\\nThis, like many solutions to big problems, does depend on an educated populace\\nthat is able to reason about the effects of certain policies. Ensuring this\\ncondition is itself a large scale societal problem that hopefully can be solved\\nwith this same line of thinking. I do admit there's a bit of a chicken-and-egg\\nproblem here :/.\\n\\n#### Nudging\\n\\nThe book [Nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)) explores one\\nphilosophy with which good policies can be crafted without impinging too much on\\nindividual liberty.\\n\\n#### Externality-based Policies\\n\\nMany societal problems are due to hard-to-track externalities of existing\\nbehaviors that are not \\\"priced in\\\" to the cost of the behavior. For instance,\\ncompanies that make unhealthy food do not pay for the healthcare costs their\\nproducts incur. Or single-use plastic producers do not pay for waste cleanup\\nefforts. Or petroleum refiners do not pay for CO2 emissions. If these\\nexternalities were priced in, then the consumer would have a much easier time\\nmaking buying decisions, as the real cost of their consumption would be obvious\\nto them.\\n\\nCurrently, it's hard to know the real cost of a given behavior, which is\\nfurther confused by emotional arguments on either side. For example, if you\\nwant to know if you should use plastic straws or not, the low price of them\\nmight make you think they are an efficient way to solve your problem. But\\nothers would argue that [some large number] of straws are used every second!\\nUnfortunately, that doesn't really tell you very much. If instead it cost a\\ndollar to clean up every discarded straw, and that was priced into the straws\\ncost since the producing company had to clean up the straws, then you as the\\nconsumer could make a more informed decision about whether that dollar is worth\\nit.\\n\\nOf course, tracking all these externalities is hard. But this seems like a\\nuseful framework, or at least more useful that trying to get consumers to all\\nindividually understand the externalities of their actions.\\n\\nProbably someone else somewhere has done a much better job exploring this\\ntopic.\\n\\n### 3. Technological Environmental Change\\n\\nNew technologies dramatically change the environment people live in.\\nInterestingly, they usually do this without requiring the bureaucracy required\\nto enact government policies. Therefore, the development of new technologies to\\nsolve societal problems, like geoengineering techniques for climate change,\\nhas a lot of potential. And some problems can **only** be solved with new\\ntechnologies (like preventing aging).\\n\\n### 4. Cultural Environmental Change\\n\\nShifting cultural norms also can lead to massive change in individual behavior.\\nI don't really know the best way this can be leveraged without the \\\"grassroots\\\"\\nproblem I mentioned above, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.\\n\\n## Personal Impact\\n\\nGiven this theory, if someone feels strongly that certain problems need to be\\nsolves, what should they do?\\n\\nInfluencing government policy is a lot of work and is, I would argue, a task\\nthat requires specialized skills. This means that someone who invests more time\\nin building these skills will hone them, and have more leverage when applying\\nthem. Therefore, an effective path to personally solving societal problems is\\nto invest a lot of time and energy in honing and applying these skills. Note\\nthat I'm not talking about lobbying here, but rather actually writing laws and\\ndoing the research that motivates their creation and design. This kind of\\nenvironment building can also be done outside of formal government in private\\norganizations that fill some roles that a government might otherwise fill.\\n\\nOur hypothetical person could also get deep into creating a technology that\\nsolves the problem they care about. This arguably takes even more time/energy\\ninvestment to see significant returns.\\n\\nFor those who do not want to, or cannot, invest time/energy in influencing\\npolicy or developing new technologies, one fallback option is to instead hone\\nanother set of skills, apply them to make money, and then fund\\npolicymakers/inventors with the proceeds. This will probably have a bigger\\nimpact than dabbling in invention/policymaking, and certainly will have a\\nbigger impact than just changing your own behavior.\\n\\nRegardless, being a [creative optimist (as opposed to a destructive\\npessimist)]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/mind/optimism.md\\\" \u003e}}) is important.\\n\\n### Hypocrisy\\n\\nIf you assume that \\\"grassroots\\\" individual change has little to no impact on\\nsocietal problems, then a lot of seemly hypocritical behavior is explained and\\neven excused. For instance, it is very reasonable to believe strongly that\\nsociety would be better if everyone was vegan, while eating the readily\\navailable non-vegan foods provided by society. It even makes some sense that\\nsomeone super passionate about some political issue - to the point where they\\norganize protests or voting campaigns - may not vote for the issue themselves!\\nIn my opinion, these behaviors are more a demonstration of how these\\nhypothetical people think they can manifest change as opposed to what they\\ntruly believe.\\n\\n## Testing this Theory\\n\\nRight now this line of thinking is just a plausible (at least to me) idea.  I\\nwould love to see some evidence for this, but don't have any at hand right now\\nto cite.  So (as always) I might be totally wrong :).\"\n  :name \"solving-societal-problems.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Society\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links [\"/docs/mind/optimism.md\"]\n  :size 9603\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1755322345\n                                 1667066083\n                                 1659551685\n                                 1659113492\n                                 1659025169\n                                 1658509129\n                                 1656388528\n                                 1656388399]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Society\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/society/utopia.md\"\n  :backlinks #{\"content/docs/me/potential-life-missions.md\"\n               \"content/docs/society/utopian-idea-management.md\"\n               \"content/docs/understanding-the-world/copyright-and-ip.md\"}\n  :title \"Utopia\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: #{\\\"content/docs/me/potential-life-missions.md\\\" \\\"content/docs/society/utopian-idea-management.md\\\" \\\"content/docs/understanding-the-world/copyright-and-ip.md\\\"}\\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Society\\\"}\\n---\\n# Achieving Utopia\\n\\n## Problems\\n\\nHumanity has some big problems that need to be solved before we can safely say\\nwe have built a utopia.\\n\\n### Wasted Human Potential\\n\\nMost people spend their productive time doing work that does not materially\\nmove our society forward.  As discussed later, people have the potential to\\ncreate completely new ideas that radically and positively improve the lives of\\nhumanity as a whole. Any work that does not leverage this potential by\\ndefinition wastes it, slowing our progress toward a utopia.\\n\\nIf our economy could somehow adequately value this potential, a lot of these\\nproblems might solve themselves (as the cost of labor would be prohibitive).\\n\\n#### Maintenance Work\\n\\nThis kind of work is currently necessary work that keeps society from\\nbacksliding.  It is extremely important, but we should be working to automate\\nit or find ways to avoid needing it to make progress.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WAe0f74Q0s\\n\\n#### Service Work\\n\\nIn my opinion, most service work is already unnecessary given the alternatives.\\nIt makes me sad to see so many people working as waiters/waitresses, cashiers,\\nin call centers, etc. when there are (often better) systems that provide the\\nsame service without requiring people.\\n\\n#### Not Seeing the Potential\\n\\nRejecting the idea that all humans have creative potential is commonplace, and\\ngreatly harms the many people that are discriminated against when selection for\\ncreative roles occurs. TODO flesh this out.\\n\\n### Death\\n\\nThe death of an individual is extremely tragic for at least these reasons:\\n\\n - All the knowledge and perspective the individual accumulated over their\\n   lifetime is lost permanently.\\n   Records can only partially remedy this.\\n - The social web the person was a part of is violently damaged.\\n - The people close to the dying person suffer greatly and are less able to\\n   create for a time (sometimes permanently).\\n\\nTo protect ourselves emotionally, we have built traditions and societal norms\\naround accepting death and treating it an inevitable.\\nGiven our progress towards understanding aging (the cause of the vast majority\\nof deaths), this is starting to become a problem.\\n\\n### War\\n\\nThe terrible combination of the above two problems. Should be avoided at all\\ncosts.\\n\\n\\n### Meritocratic Thinking\\n\\nOur society is structured so that more successful people are seen as more\\n\\\"deserving\\\" that less successful ones.\\nThis can help with motivation to be better, but leads to a lot of injustice.\\nIn my opinion the emotions of all people are equally important to maintain in a\\npositive place - meritocracy is often directly opposed to this goal.\\n\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\nIn my opinion, we should be putting **all** people to work solving the above\\nproblems. In doing so, we should be able to reach utopia more quickly, and in\\nso doing alleviate much suffering.\\n\\n### Humanity's Superpower\\n\\nPeople have the uniquely powerful ability to come up with arbitrary explanations\\nfor how stuff works and then critically compare them against each other.\\nThis creative process has led to all major advances in human history, and is\\nresponsible for the accelerating rate of progress we all enjoy today.\\nThis progress is in turn responsible for alleviating a tremendous amount of\\nsuffering, and for creating a myriad of new ways for people to feel happy,\\nsatisfied, or otherwise good.\\nIt also has enabled people to automate many time and energy consuming tasks that\\nhave historically either directly caused suffering, or gotten in the way of\\nfurther progress and/or doing things that feel good.\\n\\nCreative thought as I've defined it is the most important tool we have to\\nimprove our state as a species (and to continue avoiding existential threats).\\nTherefore, we should be primarily orienting our society to encourage creative\\nthought and reduce the amount of time required to engage in non-creative work to\\nkeep things running.\\nIf we can successfully do this, then we will maximize our ability to solve all\\nother hard problems facing our species, such as resource shortages, aging,\\nclimate change, and successfully governing ourselves.\\nAdditionally, arguably people will lead more fulfilling lives, as more of their\\ntime will be spent thinking about interesting things and sharing those thoughts\\nas opposed to grinding away at Sisyphean maintenance tasks.\\n\\nHow can we do this?\\n\\n### Basic Need Satisfaction\\n\\nWe need to ensure that every person on earth has their basic (food, shelter,\\nmedicine, mental health) needs met through automation.\\nWorrying about basic needs is probably the biggest distraction away from\\ncreative thought that exists today.\\n\\nWorrying about basic needs and/or accumulation of wealth for a rainy day can\\nalso lead to perverse incentives, where someone will work on something with\\nmoney as their only object.\\nIdeally, our economic system would make the most useful work the most lucrative\\n(and this problem wouldn't exist), but unfortunately this isn't always the case.\\nThis leads to the all too common situation where people choose not to do the\\nmost helpful/important thing they could be because another option is more\\nlucrative.\\n\\nA simple solution to this would be to supply everyone with a nanofabricator that\\ncan produce food, tools, and everything else required to survive.\\nUnfortunately, currently this solution is still science fiction, and we instead\\nmust rely on large shared systems that utilize economies of scale to provide\\nneeds at a minimum cost.\\nDistributing resources in these systems is hard, and our growing wealth\\ninequality today is evidence that we are doing a poor job.\\n\\nSo far, some kind of universal basic income seems to me to be the best short\\nterm solution to this problem.\\nThis would provide a \\\"floor\\\" that people wouldn't be able to fall beneath.\\nIt would also allow markets to keep service production efficient, which wouldn't\\nnecessarily be the case if the government simply provided the needs directly.\\n\\n#### Tyranny of Other People\\n\\nAll societies have some parts in which people are at the mercy of other people\\nwho control their employment status, political status, time, and/or access to\\nresources.\\nThis often leads to disasterous results (see the atrocities committed by\\ntotalitarian regimes, or the depression caused by an abusive boss) and in\\ngeneral creates a lot of daily stress for the people that have to make sure\\ntheir controllers are happy with them.\\nBasic need satisfaction would go a long way towards eliminating this problem as\\nwell.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Freedom of Information and Education\\n\\nIt's hard to think creatively when you have no prior ideas to remix together\\ninto new ones.\\nMaking information and educational resources universally accessible and engaging\\nis crucial to spark creativity.\\nTo do this we should continue encouraging the growth of the internet, and the\\ngrowth of free and open publication of scientific discovery (and thoughts in\\ngeneral).\\nPeople who write down novel ideas should have their needs covered by the\\nautomation described above, and therefore will not need to worry about how to\\nmonetize their work (which wastes everyone's time and energy, and cuts people\\nout of the creative process).\\n\\nSpecifically, I think we should severely limit copyright laws and allow people\\nto copy and access all digital content freely, including source code, movies,\\nbooks, school courses, \\\"trade secrets\\\", etc.\\nDirect compensation for this work would come from UBI and possibly grants if UBI\\ndoesn't cover all expenses.\\n\\n\\n### Freedom of Direction\\n\\nIn the book [\\\"Greatness Cannot be Planned: The Myth of the Objective\\\"]({{\u003c\\nrelref \\\"/docs/books/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned.md\\\" \u003e}}), the authors argue\\nthat all hard problems suffer from deceptive paths to their solutions.\\nTherefore, attempting to grade or judge performance by comparing a current state\\nto a specific goal is misleading.\\nThis focus on objective thinking is particularly dangerous when applied to\\npeople - using objectives to encourage someone to do X or Y stifles that persons\\nability to exercise their most powerful tool: their creativity.\\nInstead, that person will just act in accordance with the given objective, even\\nif they have novel ideas they would otherwise try to pursue.\\n\\nTo approach utopia, it makes sense to try to constrain the behavior of\\nindividuals as little as possible so that the most novel ideas can be explored.\\nOne way this could be conceptualized is by encouraging\\n[flaneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur)-like behavior as described\\nin [\\\"Antifragile\\\" by NN Taleb]({{\u003c relref \\\"/docs/books/antifragile.md\\\" \u003e}}).\\nThis has the additional side benefit of giving people space, time, and therefore\\nability to support the ideas of others that they discover and think are\\nimportant.\\nRelated is Taleb's [\\\"Convex\\nTinkering\\\"](https://fooledbyrandomness.com/ConvexityScience.pdf) concept, which\\nsupports the idea that randomly exploring many ideas is perhaps the most\\nefficient path to discovery.\\n\\n#### Organizations\\n\\nThis concept can also apply to larger organizations of many people, like local\\ngovernments.\\nIf those governments have a lot of freedom to experiment with different\\npolicies, this could lead to discovery of the best policies overall.\\nIn practice, this would looks like a confederation of autonomous states, like\\nSwitzerland and to a lesser extent the United States of America.\\n\\nAt the government level, this experimentation can be dangerous, so it is crucial\\nthat people are able to leave governments that they anticipate will harm them.\\nThis means that both some kind of universal bill of rights and resources that\\nhelp people move are extremely important.\\n\\n\\n##

me.\\n\\nIdeas and information more generally is derived from existing info, no matter\\nhow \\\"original\\\" it may look.\\nThis means that:\\n\\n1. Any \\\"right\\\" to own ideas/info is just as valid as the \\\"right\\\" a LLM has over\\n   the work it produces (none at all).\\n2. Restricting the free usage/remixing of information will stymie further\\n   progress, as new creators will have less information to work with when\\n   synthesizing old ideas into new ones.\\n\\nIf we do decide to remove all forms of idea ownership (copywrite, trade secrets,\\netc.), this has several large downsides in our current society:\\n\\n1. Some jobs will be much less profitable (e.g. writing, commercial research).\\n2. There will be less incentive to innovate.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to do this effectively, we need some new societal structures/systems.\\n\\n## New Systems\\n\\n### UBI\\n\\nSome form of basic income is required for this to work out.\\nThis will remove the human (salary) costs from the equation of generating new\\nideas.\\nFor many creative workers (e.g. digital artists, writers, etc.), this should be\\nenough to enable them to continue creating.\\n\\n### Grantmaking\\n\\nFor some info generation (drug discovery, clinical trials, movies), salary of workers is\\nonly part of the cost of the process.\\nThe creation itself also consumes resources.\\nTo make this kind of creation possible, I propose a diverse grantmaking\\necosystem funded out of the same pool as UBI.\\nThis would include grants determined by:\\n\\n1. Popular vote\\n2. Expert commitee\\n3. Random lottery\\n\\nIt's crucial to have a variety of ways to give grants to make sure all ideas\\nhave some chance at being explored, even if they are niche or unpopular.\\n\\n## Unfree Information\\n\\nSome information should still be restricted.

If there are few large tests, they make take a long time doing\\nlots of computations that I don't care about in the process of testing my\\nfunction.\\n\\nOne solution to this is to write unit tests that test every function.\\nThis is widely recommended, but also laborious and at times \\\"flow-killing\\\".\\nAlso if your system is composed of many small functions, it can be hard to\\nmotivate yourself to write multiple tests for every single one.\\n\\nAnother solution is to use a debugger, and stop execution of your program at\\nthe function in question and use the context from the debugger to fix the\\nproblem.

editor.\\nWith your cursor in a function, you would hit a hotkey and the function would be\\nrun with the last input (or N inputs) that it saw during its last execution,\\nshowing you the return value and any print/log statement outputs.\\n\\nProbably this is much easier to implement (or much more likely to already\\nexist) in an interpreted language like Python or Javascript.\\n\\nThis could also make reading code much easier, as example data would be just a\\nhotkey away.\\n\\nThis is similar to using a REPL in Clojure with generative test case-ing via\\nspec, but crucially captures data that causes errors in a real run of the\\nprogram (unlike Clojure with a REPL and random data).\\n\\nConversation about this idea:\\n\\n -

least easily perceived as such),\\nsince most functions will probably never be broken, especially if they are kept\\nsmall.\\n\\nSpicy take on that one.\\n\\nI think the problem you are running against is that you want to define your\\ncode, then write your tests to verify it doesn't change (correctness regression\\nchecking).\\nI'd assert this is the wrong way to approach testing behavior.\\nYou should consider reading on\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development (a off-shoot of TDD)\\nin which you write tests of API behavior before writing the code itself.\\nIf you can change your code without failing your tests, then by definition it is\\ncorrect.\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:09 PM\\ni know 😛 I didn't feel like being more nuanced as I was getting this off my head. \\n\\nYou're right that some form of TDD would solve this problem.\\nBut if you are not doing TDD this would be nice.\\nI feel like the pros and cons of TDD are a big rabbit hole that might be fun to\\ndiscuss more (perhaps in the programming discussion group?).\\nI guess I'll just say that I have done a LOT more non-TDD programming than TDD\\nprogramming, but maybe that's just me\\n\\nTim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:11 PM\\nI think Tanner's response only begs the question of which API you're testing.\\nAt which level.\\nAre you doing BDD on the interfaces between large subsystems?\\nOnly on your public API  (what which point your space of possible inputs/ouputs\\nis ~infinite)?\\nIf you squint right, a unit test on a function is BDD applied to the interface\\nof that specific function.\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:11 PM, Edited\\nAlso to clarify, if you are doing some kind of test driven development where you\\nhave only high level public interface tests written first (maybe this is BDD?)\\nyou would still be writing nested functions without tests\\n\\nAndrew Stewart, Jan 19, 2022, 4:11 PM\\nI wouldn't say I do much BDD / TDD, but a lack of unit tests is a major code smell\\n\\n+1 to what Tim said, depends a lot on which layer you're testing or not testing\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:12 PM\\nthe inspiration for my idea was to smooth the code writing/reading process, NOT\\nto replace unit tests\\n\\njust to be clear\\n\\nTim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:13 PM\\nTo Kovas's initial question...\\nI've thought about this very thing too Kovas.\\nI think you could implement such a thing very similarly to how we do image diff\\ntesting with SCUBA.\\nSpecifically, the tooling helps A LOT in the ergonomics of accepting desired\\nchanges that might effect lots of \\\"goldens\\\", showing diffs between \\\"goldens\\\" and\\nvariants, etc.\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:14 PM\\nisn't SCUBA just helping interpret test results at a very high level tho?\\nwhat if it takes 20+ seconds for your scuba test to run?\\n\\n(i haven't used SCUBA, so maybe it's faster)\\n\\nTanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:16 PM\\nI suppose my assertion is that if you have code which isn't tested then there is\\nliterally no definition of correct except for the behavior as written, which\\nbecomes also correct when changed in arbitrary ways.\\n\\nIf you are debugging something you are trying to figure out why it is not\\ncorrect, but you should have an assertion that it is indeed not correct before\\nyou attempt to \\\"fix\\\" the code\\n\\nTim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:16 PM\\nActually my idea is different from yours.\\nYoure talking about saving off the inputs.\\nI was talking about saving off the outputs.\\n\\nTake all the tests we do which EXPECT protos to have certain fields.\\nI've wondered...\\nwhat if we just dumped all the wanted protos to text format in a file...\\nand then saved that file as a golden, and used diff tools to see the difference?\\nThe benefit is you avoid having to have written all those test cases.\\n\\nThen add proto-level annotations in order to automatically ignore fields that\\ncan change (e.g. timestamps)\\n\\nSorry to take it off track 😀\\n\\nTanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:18 PM\\nPractically speaking though, I think you could look up auto-generated\\nparameterized unit tests to match the idea you've had\\n\\nTim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:20 PM\\nyeah\\n\\nAndrew Stewart, Jan 19, 2022, 4:21 PM\\nIt's not a mechanism for capturing inputs, but stuff like\\ngoogle3/testing/production_stub/public/testvalue.h does allow tests to inject\\nvalues in tests that might otherwise be difficult\\n\\nTanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:22 PM\\nAt my old company we would use a system of input generators which were called\\n\\\"Arbitrary[x]\\\" which would generate an arbitrary instance of X.\\nThis is similar to proto generators I suppose, but slightly more nuanced in that\\nyou could define what an arbitrary instance looks like and relationships between\\ndata on it.\\nThen when you tested the interface, you would construct said arbitrary instance\\nof your inputs with constraints on specific things you cared about, and very\\nergonomically write unit tests in a BDD fashion (with associated language)\\n\\nSee https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/generator_driven_property_checks if you\\nare interested; I very much like that style of testing\\n\\nand https://www.scala-exercises.org/scalacheck/arbitrary\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:26 PM\\nHere's a more concrete example of how I think this would be useful:\\n\\nYou're debugging a flaky error in a program that normally takes a while to run.  You could: \\n(1) Run the program with a debugger/print statements multiple times to try to\\ntriangulate what function is causing the error so you can reproduce the issue in\\na unit test, then fix the function.\\n(2) With this idea, you run the program once, then run individual functions with\\nthe saved input data until you find the problem, write your test, and fix it.\\n\\nIn case (2) there is less waiting and more interactive development\\n\\nTim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:26 PM\\n@Tanner Young Would that be similar to adding lots of assert statements that\\ncheck that certain relationships between your data hold, and then feeding in\\narbitrary data?\\n\\nTanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:27 PM\\n@Tim Ford  in implementation no; it does not generate random data and then\\nverify assertions on it.\\nYou instead write your own generator using more basic building blocks (like\\nother generators).\\n\\n\u003e You're debugging a flaky error in a program that normally takes a while to run.  You could: \\n\\nJust use the original flake error, no?\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM\\nbut what if you're not sure which function is causing the error?\\n\\nTanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM\\nI guess it depends, I was only thinking about test execution order as a source\\nof flake (which can be reproduced), doesn't work for thread locking errors\\n\\nTim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM\\n@Kovas Palunas I guess I see what you're saying...\\nin practice, in such scenarios, I think I usually find a place where a test\\nshould be but isn't.\\nor where a test is wrong or incomplete\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM\\ni agree, but finding the root cause has to be done before you can write the missing test\\n\\nTanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM\\nThis is especially difficult for classes of parallel execution errors..\\n\\nKovas Palunas, Jan 19, 2022, 4:29 PM\\nyep that's true\\n\\nTim Ford, Jan 19, 2022, 4:39 PM\\nyeah...\\nif you could replay all sources of input to the program (not individual\\nfunctions), then you could attach a debugger, set whatever breakpoints you might\\nwant, and then replay.\\nIn a past game development job we did something like that.\\nBut with parallelism issues, the kernel's scheduling decisions are inputs, and\\nyou have subtle timing issues too...\\nso yeah, it could not handle that kind of thing\\n\\nI think that class of issue is better handled with something like TSan or Rust\\n\\nstatic or dynamic data race detection/prevention\\n\\nTanner Young, Jan 19, 2022, 4:39 PM\\n\u003e I think that class of issue is better handled with something like TSan or Rust\\n\\nNow we're talking...\\n\\nAndrew Stewart, Jan 19, 2022, 4:59 PM\\nNot explicitly related to the topic, but http://go/atomic-danger talks about some things that are difficult to test\\n\\nDavid Poliakoff, Jan 20, 2022, 7:42 AM\\nAnother use case for this was at my last job, we often couldn't share entire\\nsensitive codes or inputs externally, but could share security-reviewed\\nsnippets.\\nSo we would often write code that would wrap functions, typically at a library\\nboundary, and record inputs.\\nThen we would be able to relaunch functions with those given inputs.\\n\\n It turned out to be pretty expensive to do in practice.\\n Personally I'm of an \\\"if you can test it, do test it\\\" mentality.\\n There were also efforts in resilience, though, which could detect whether the\\n same execution of a kernel/function could produce substantively different\\n outputs, if you're looking for nondeterminism.\\n```\\n\u003c/details\u003e\"\n  :name \"auto-input-data-collection.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Software Dev\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 11590\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1688672321\n                                 1688488756\n                                 1688414476\n                                 1688412623\n                                 1688412590\n                                 1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1643566176\n                                 1642635677]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Software Dev\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/software-dev/choosing-a-language.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Choosing A Language\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Software Dev\\\"}\\n---\\n# Choosing a Language\\n\\nWhen deciding what programming language to use, there are several important\\nfactors:\\n\\n**The ergonomics of the language itself.**  This includes things like the\\ntype system, immutability/functional programming support, OOP support, etc.\\nMostly, these features contribute to how pleasant it is to develop in the\\nlanguage, which leads to productivity gains and potentially ease of debugging.\\n\\n**The library/tooling ecosystem around the language.**  Some very non-ergonomic\\nlanguages may still be the right choice because lots of libraries have been\\nwritten for that language, so the total amount of work to do to accomplish\\nanything is dramatically reduced.

Each neuron\\nwould have multiple other neurons connected to it's \\\"input\\\" side, and connect\\nto one other neuron as it's \\\"output\\\".  It would carry a single \\\"fire/no fire\\\"\\nsignal during every tick of time.  The signal would be \\\"fire\\\" if during the\\nlast tick more than half (or some percent) of the input signals were \\\"fire\\\",\\notherwise it would be \\\"no fire\\\".\\n\\nNeurons would be grouped arbitrarily into sub-networks with relatively few\\ninputs/outputs compared to the interconnections within them.\\n\\n## Evolution\\n\\nThe model would evolve using a random application of the following changes:\\n\\n1. A random neuron would move its output side to another random neuron, with a\\n   preference to move its output to neurons \\\"close\\\" to it, as judged by\\n   distance in the graph.\\n1. A random neuron would be replaced by a copy of another neuron group with the\\n   same number of inputs and a single random output.  This is simulating\\n   \\\"creativity\\\", or the combining of disparate ideas.  Another way to do this\\n   would be to connect a single neuron's output to the input of another group,\\n   although this may lead to situations where that new group becomes\\n   ineffective due to overloading of random inputs.\\n\\nEvolution can happen to a network during its normal running (it can learn on\\nthe fly).\\n\\nIt might be interesting to think more about the difference between \\\"learning\\\"\\nand \\\"evolution\\\" - perhaps at a certain point only \\\"learning\\\" will be allowed,\\nand not \\\"evolution\\\".  To start out with it probably makes sense to not\\ndemarcate these.\\n\\n## Input/Output\\n\\nThe entire network would have a very simple output (perhaps even just one\\nbinary signal), and few/no inputs.\\n\\n## Starting Points\\n\\nI think the nervous system of _C. elegans_ has been completely mapped, so maybe\\ncopying that would be a good place to start?\\n\\n## Objectives\\n\\nI don't really know what to do here (how to bias the network to evolve in a\\nspecific direction, or how to reward it for making \\\"good\\\" changes).\\n\\n## Prior Art\\n\\n - https://github.com/uber-research/backpropamine\"\n  :name \"artificial-intelligence.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Thought Experiments\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 2393\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1648766627\n                                 1646243696\n                                 1646242938]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Thought Experiments\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/thought-experiments/life-quests.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Life Quests\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Thought Experiments\\\"}\\n---\\n# Life Quests\\n\\nOne exciting way to spend time is to try to complete little open-ended\\nchallenges under time pressure.

If you find or do one of these things let me know!\\n\\n\\n## Programming\\n\\n### Make $1 on the Internet\\n\\nWill probably lead to an interesting journey!\\n\\n### \\\"System 1\\\" Chatbot\\n\\nA chatbot that simulates talking to the \\\"system 1\\\" part of the brain only as\\ndescribed in \\\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\\".\\n\\n### Album Cover Quiz Site\\n\\nGiven an album cover (or movie cover or book cover), try to guess its genre or\\nother things about it.  Basically [this](http://playjudgey.com/).  \\n\\n### Money Conversion App/Site\\n\\nAn app that allows the user to compare current market values of different\\nthings.  For example, avocados to dollars or hours of specific work to rocks\\netc.  Would be cool to have a web page associated that points out interesting\\ncomparisons.  \\n\\n### String Image Formatter\\n\\nWrite a program that takes in a string and an image file, then adds\\nnewlines/spaces/formatting to the string so that it looks like the image when\\nviewed from a distance.  If the string is too short to work, repeat it or\\nsomehow compress the image so it works out perfectly.  \\n\\n### Synonym Finder\\n\\nA program (or text editor plugin) where you can search text using all synonyms\\nof the words you typed to search.  For example, searching some documentation for\\n\\\"log\\\" would search for the word \\\"log\\\", but also (and with lower priority) the\\nwords \\\"stderr\\\", \\\"stdout\\\", \\\"output\\\", etc.  This could also just be build in to\\nthe search bar, where a window would pop up containing reframings of what you\\nsearched for, as suggestions for what else to try.  \\n\\n### See Through Walls with VR/AR\\n\\nTry to (using google maps or pre-collected data) model an object in the real\\nworld at its exact real world position in a VR or AR simulation.  For example,\\nmodel a toothbrush in a bathroom so that when using VR in the living room you\\ncan \\\"see through walls\\\" to see exactly the toothbrush.  Could be used to show\\nlarge objects around the world at their exact positions (like the Eiffel tower\\nor Mt Everest).  This would have a cool effect of giving you a really good\\nbearing on your location with respect to the rest of the world.  \\n\\n### Word Traversal Game\\n\\nMake a word game where you try to get from one word to another via connections\\nsuch as:\\n\\n - Words used in the same sentence of a given book\\n - Synonyms/Antonyms\\n\\nhttps://www.word.golf/ is pretty close to this. It would be cool if it could be\\nextended to other ways of connecting words.\\n\\n### Open Twitter\\n\\nA social network that just provides a raw database of tweets or posts and lets\\nmany third party sites pop up that censor/curate/organize the posts/tweets in\\ndifferent ways.\\n\\n### Memorization Game Mod\\n\\nMod a game you play often (e.g. Skyrim) so that random quips (e.g. \\\"arrow to\\nthe knee\\\") are replaced by random facts you want to memorize.\\n\\n\\n## Lifestyle Optimization\\n\\n### Water Saving Toilet\\n\\nMake a toilet where urine is redirected (like a composting toilet) into a\\nseparate area with no water in it (the back of the toilet still has water).\\nThen, when you pee in that area you don't need to flush, but when you poop (or\\notherwise flush), the rising water will drain into the pee area as well,\\nwashing it.  This should reduce the number of flushes per day by a lot for the\\naverage toilet.\\n\\n### \\\"Feeling\\\" Biomarkers\\n\\nTry hooking up a continuous glucose (or other biomarker) monitor up to a\\nvibration arm band (as discussed in the book \\\"Livewired\\\" by David Eagleman) to\\n\\\"feel\\\" blood glucose concentration.\\n\\n### Hot Water Towel Rack\\n\\nExtend the hot water pipe that feeds a shower outside of the wall in a towel\\nrack shape.\\nThis will let the water flowing through the pipe heat your towel so it's nice\\nand warm when you go to dry off.\\n\\n### Upside Down Keyboard\\n\\nPut your keyboard and mouse underneath your desk and use them with your palms\\nfacing up.\\nThis might help with RSI or at least would be a funny joke to surprise coworkers\\nwith.\\n\\n\\n## Amusing\\n\\n### Musical Toothbrush\\n\\nA vibrating toothbrush that can accept a midi or other audio file. Then it will\\nmodulate the vibrations to the tune of the audio.\\n\\n### Random Ice Prank\\n\\nPut [two liquids that\\nfreeze](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b00239) (or get cold)\\nwhen mixed in a laundry machine, surprising whoever goes to transfer their\\nclothes!\\n\\n### Reverse Car Wash\\n\\nInstead of (or in addition to) spinning the bristles in a car wash, spin the\\ncar instead!\\nMore specifically, move the car around quickly like an amusement park ride so \\nthat it rubs against the bristles.\\n\\n\\n## Data Exploration\\n\\n### Ambiguous Acronyms\\n\\nMake a survey with ambiguous acronyms and see how the results differ based on\\nthe community that's being asked (e.g. AC could be Armor Class or Air\\nConditioning). This could be done on subreddits.\\n\\n### Regular Break Lifelogging\\n\\nEvery 30 minutes get up, walk around, and quickly note down what the last 30\\nminutes was spent doing. Then use that data for cool visualizations.\\n\\n### Tracking Digestion with Center of Mass\\n\\nUse body's center of mass to estimate digestion progress/state.  Presumably\\nright after eating mass is centered in the stomach, then slowly diffuses to\\nother parts of the body\\n\\n\\n## Food\\n\\n### Bell Pepper Cup\\n\\nCut the top off of a bell pepper and use it as a cup.  \\n\\n### Popped Potatoes\\n\\nPop potatoes like corn by wrapping them in a hard shell and cooking them.\\n\\n### Refried Bean Pizza\\n\\nPut refried beans on pizza.\\n\\n### Selling Chip Dust\\n\\nCompanies should sell the flavoring blends that flavor potato chips.\\n\\n\\n## Cultural\\n\\n### Day of Music\\n\\nA holiday where everyone in their own homes/neighborhoods plays along to a\\nsingle song in whatever way they can.\\n\\n### 1000 Hour Tattoos\\n\\nEverybody has a list of activities that they've done for a thousand hours or\\nmore.\\nIt would be cool if people had a piece of jewelry with removable parts like a\\nnecklace with beads, and each activity that they've done for over a thousand\\nhours would be represented by one bead.\\nYou could also do this with a tattoo where you have different parts of a pattern\\ninterlinking, with each part representing an activity.\\n\\nI think this would be a cool way to start conversations and also show people\\nthat people spend a lot of time doing things that you may not expect just by\\nlooking at them.\\nEspecially things that are mindless or relaxing; everybody would have a bead for\\nsleeping but people might also have beads for zoning out.\\nI think visualizing this is a good way of normalizing the fact that everybody\\nneeds that kind of time.\\nAnd that that kind of time isn't an impediment to success, because many people\\nthat you may aspire to be like may have beads like that, which shows that\\nthey're more human than you might think.\\n\\n\\n## Artistic\\n\\n### Monthly Clock Garden\\n\\nMake a circular (or square) yard with 12 plants that each bloom during each\\nmonth of the year.\\n\\n### Mood Ring Contacts\\n\\nContact for you eyes that change their color based on your mood.  For example,\\nred eyes could signify anger, black eyes depressions, blue eyes calm, green\\neyes joy, etc.\\n\\n### Encoding Vocal Inflection in Text\\n\\nIn March 2022 I started using text to speech converters to generate audiobooks\\nfor me to listen to on commutes. The biggest difference I noticed between robot\\naudio and a human reading out loud is that spacing between words and vocal\\ninflections don't always happen in the same way. For instance, a robot voice\\nmay not give weight to a sentence that a human would.\\n\\nIt would be neat if an author could somehow encode this vocal inflection in\\ntheir text (by using bold/italics or special characters) in such a way that a\\ntext to speech encoder could react to, to generate more natural sounding audio.\\n\\nPoets (or artistic authors) could even hijack this system to instead add\\nbizarre inflection to their text such that it would sound strange when\\ntext-to-speechified. I imagine you could do some pretty wild stuff here, from\\ncreating novel accents to spicing up rhyming verses. This technique would also\\nallow you to encode sounds in writing that are impossible for a human voice to\\nmake.\\n\\n### Laser Cut Leaves\\n\\nEtch some cool pattern in tough, large leaves (treating them like paper).\\n\\n### Laser Cut Flip Book\\n\\n#### Main Idea\\n\\nCreate a flip book by laser engraving a stack of thin wood (or thick paper)\\npieces, each with one frame of a gif or short video.  Then, create a box that\\nthe stack can fit into snugly, with one of the walls perpendicular to the stack\\nremoved.  In the place of that wall, put a mobile rod (or just make the wall\\nremovable).  If you then turn the box so that the rod or movable wall is facing\\nthe ground, you can remove the wall and let the pieces fall downward, advancing\\nthe frame and animating the gif/video.\\n\\n#### Variation\\n\\nMake the stack of frames, then drill a hole in one corner and thread a rod\\nthrough the stack.  You should be able to then rotate the stack around like a\\nspiral staircase.  Maybe you can animate it like this?\\n\\n### Table Fountain\\n\\nIf you have a round table to eat at that seats ~4 people, put a symmetrical\\nfountain like those found in gardens in the middle for people to use to refill\\ntheir water cups.  Could have four streams for easier filling.\"\n  :name \"random-ideas.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Thought Experiments\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 9254\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1697236141\n                                 1694034285\n                                 1667066083\n                                 1661202031\n                                 1661202005\n                                 1658554077\n                                 1658553735\n                                 1658277343\n                                 1658206871\n                                 1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1654381598\n                                 1654023324\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1653190047\n                                 1650829356\n                                 1649785449\n                                 1649286357\n                                 1648862610]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Thought Experiments\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/thought-experiments/two-glasses.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Two Glasses\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Thought Experiments\\\"}\\n---\\n# Mixing Milk Tea\\n\\nGiven a glass of tea and a glass of (almond) milk, each 9/10ths full, how many\\ntimes would you need to mix the glasses for each to contain a 50% mixture of tea\\nand milk?\\n\\nThis python code:\\n\\n```\\nmax_size = 10\\na_volume, a_tea_fraction = 9, 1.0\\nb_volume, b_tea_fraction = 9, 0.0\\nmixes = 0\\nwhile a_tea_fraction \u003e 0.51:\\n mixes += 1\\n print(mixes, a_tea_fraction, b_tea_fraction)\\n if a_volume != max_size:\\n   # Mix B into A\\n   amount_transferred = max_size - a_volume\\n   a_tea_fraction = (a_volume * a_tea_fraction\\n                     + amount_transferred * b_tea_fraction) / max_size\\n   a_volume = max_size\\n   b_volume -= amount_transferred\\n else:\\n   # Mix A into B\\n   amount_transferred = max_size - b_volume\\n   b_tea_fraction = (b_volume * b_tea_fraction\\n                     + amount_transferred * a_tea_fraction) / max_size\\n   b_volume = max_size\\n   a_volume -= amount_transferred\\n```\\n\\nsays this:\\n\\n```\\n1 1.0 0.0\\n2 0.9 0.0\\n3 0.9 0.18\\n4 0.756 0.18\\n5 0.756 0.2952\\n6 0.66384 0.2952\\n7 0.66384 0.36892800000000003\\n8 0.6048576 0.36892800000000003\\n9 0.6048576 0.41611392\\n10 0.5671088639999999 0.41611392\\n11 0.5671088639999999 0.4463129088000001\\n12 0.54294967296 0.4463129088000001\\n13 0.54294967296 0.465640261632\\n14 0.5274877906944 0.465640261632\\n15 0.5274877906944 0.47800976744448\\n16 0.517592186044416 0.47800976744448\\n17 0.517592186044416 0.4859262511644672\\n18 0.5112589990684262 0.4859262511644672\\n19 0.5112589990684262 0.49099280074525903\\n```\\n\\nGetting to complete 50-50 would take a very long time, but getting close takes\\nabout 16 mixes.\\n\\n## Follow up questions\\n\\nIf I only wanted to mix N times, how much milk tea can I make with two glasses\\nof fixed size?\"\n  :name \"two-glasses.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Thought Experiments\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 1737\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1633990351]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Toys\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/toys/yo-yo.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Yo Yo\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Toys\\\"}\\n---\\n# Yo-Yo\\n\\nIs fun!\"\n  :name \"yo-yo.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Toys\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 17\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1757136307]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Understanding The World\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/understanding-the-world/applying-theories.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Applying Theories\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Understanding The World\\\"}\\n---\\n# Applying Theories\\n\\n**NOTE: This is a very rough draft, and in some ways doesn't really make sense\\n: )**\\n\\nOne way to look at learning is as a cyclical process:\\n\\n1. Have some experiences in the world.\\n1. Mentally find commonalities between those experiences and create an abstract\\n   model in your head to help predict what might happen in a similar, future\\n   experience.\\n1. Test your model by having that future experience and seeing what happens.\\n1. Refine or discard the model as more experiences inform it.\\n\\nA key trap to avoid falling in to here is exiting the loop and believing that\\nyour model is \\\"the truth\\\". This assumes that all possible experiences have been\\nexplored, which is impossible.\\n\\nThe presence of this trap does **not** mean abstract theories are useless or\\nnot worth developing (because you will never find their solution). Abstract\\nmodels are in fact very useful as tools in your toolbox when approaching a new\\nexperience. They just must be applied as hypotheses, and held lightly.\\n\\nThis kind of thinking can be hard sometimes, because it sort-of involves\\nholding two conflicting ideas in your head ([which is\\npainful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance))[^1]. These are:\\n\\n[^1]: Note this this isn't the most common way the term cognitive dissonance is\\n  used - usually it explains the pain that directs people towards ignoring new\\n  information that conflicts with their existing beliefs.\\n\\n1. The theory explains how something abstract works.\\n1. The theory is only applicable in some concrete scenerios (and even then, may\\n   not be correct).\\n\\nThis is a bit of a paradox because to describe an abstract theory you\\nnecessarily must state that it works in an abstract context. They key is\\nrealizing that this explanation is incomplete. So you kinda have to \\\"believe a\\nlie\\\" in part to apply the theory.\\n\\n\\n## Example: Personality Typing\\n\\nOne very abstract theory is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)\\nfor personality typing. It attempts to condense the complexity of an individual\\nperson into a 4 letter code (4 binary dimensions) that describes their\\nbehavior. This is extremely abstract and incomplete.\\n\\nDespite the oversimplicity of MBTI, it can still be useful. For example, if two\\npeople are clashing because they are approaching a problem in two different\\nways (and each thinks their way is best), MBTI can give them a language with\\nwhich to see the validity of the other person's approach. Here the theory acts\\nas a neutral third party to help settle the dispute.\\n\\nIt could also not work in this situation at all depending on the people. The\\ndanger is believing too much that the theory is correct and trying to force\\nits application. This is where general theories become dangerous. The best\\napproach if the theory's application isn't leading to practically useful\\nresults (here helping the two people see eye-to-eye) is to move on to the next\\ntheory in the toolbox that could help.\\n\\n\\n## Giving Advice\\n\\nOften advice takes the form of an abstract adage or theory that the advice\\ngiver thinks will help the advice seeker. Just like with applying theories in\\nother ways, IMO advice is best given as a hypotheses; a \\\"this might help you\\\"\\nkind of statement.\\n\\nA lot of interpersonal tension and harm can come when the advice giver assumes\\nthat the theory 100% applies to the seekers situation. In this case, if the\\nseeker doesn't follow the theory, the giver would conclude that the seeker\\n\\\"just doesn't get it\\\" or is otherwise misinterpreting them. Then they might\\npush the theory and start to feel unheard or ignored. The issue here is that it\\nis really really hard to know what is going on in the seeker's mind (only they\\nmight know, but even that is not guaranteed).

Both help you make your own\\ndecisions:\\n\\n### Reason 1: To help you determine if you should make the same decision or not.\\n\\nThis is fairly straightforward: if someone else has already gone through the\\nwork of making a decision, it can be easier to try to judge their decision\\ninstead of coming up with your own from scratch. If you deem their decision\\ngood, then you can simply make it. Otherwise, you'll have a starting off point\\nfor making your own decision.\\n\\n### Reason 2: To help you determine if the decision maker is to be trusted with other similar decisions.\\n\\nA common concrete application is hiring. Interviews are ultimately trying to\\ndetermine if a candidate will be good at the job, which can be modeled as a\\nbunch of decisions. If the candidate is bad at making the decisions they will\\nneed to in their work, then they shouldn't be hired.\\n\\n## How?\\n\\nI think judging decisions is really tricky. The idea I outline here is just\\nthat: an idea. I don't claim that this is better than other methods, or that\\nit's even useful at all in practice.\\n\\nOne way to judge decisions is by seeing them as a tree of considerations. For\\nexample:\\n\\n- Should I vote for candidate X or Y?\\n - Which candidate will be better for the economy?\\n  - Which candidate will be better for my local economy?\\n - Which candidate's morals align more with my own?\\n - Which candidate do I think is more honest?\\n\\nFor many decisions, a massively complex tree of possibilities can be built.\\nWhen these trees are explored by decision makers, most of the exploration is\\nonly done in their heads, and only the parts deemed most important are\\nvocalized or written down when presenting the decision.\\n\\nI propose that one way to judge the quality of a decision is by the decision\\nmaker's ability to express their exploration of this tree. The fewer questions\\nyou can ask that are unanswered by the decision maker's justification, the\\nbetter.\\n\\nThis approach can be used in technical interviews, or judgment of someone's\\nwork (e.g. when evaluating performance), by asking yourself \\\"How much of the\\npossibility space has this person explored?\\\".\"\n  :name \"judging-decisions.md\"\n  :private false\n  :categories #{\"Understanding The World\"}\n  :dir? false\n  :links []\n  :size 2309\n  :modtime 1757654749\n  :mode 420\n  :modification-unix-timestamps [1655753252\n                                 1655753185\n                                 1655657180\n                                 1653846065\n                                 1638937972]}\n {:path-categories #{\"Understanding The World\"}\n  :path \"content/docs/understanding-the-world/notetaking.md\"\n  :backlinks nil\n  :title \"Notetaking\"\n  :markdown \"---\\nbacklinks-set: \\ncategories-set: #{\\\"Understanding The World\\\"}\\n---\\n# Notes on Notetaking\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- https://tkainrad.dev/posts/managing-my-personal-knowledge-base/\\n- https://vimways.org/2019/personal-notetaking-in-vim/\\n\\n## Graph Notetaking Idea\\n\\nUse a set of nodes connected to other notes in a graph (like\\n[zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)) to store knowledge.\\nEach note should have:\\n\\n - Constraints under which the notes info doesn't apply (limitation of a study)\\n - Some new knowledge, assuming the constraint\\n - References to other notes\\n\\nIn addition, the body of notes should contain guiding essays that string\\ntogether notes in an easy to understand way.

Any dietary sugar crystallizes in the blood, causing arterial damage.\\n - Sugar has no harmful effects on the body when \u003c50g/day are consumed.\\n - Saturated fat hardens in the blood, clogging arteries.\\n - Saturated fat does not clog arteries, it gets dissolved in blood just fine.\\n\\n### Economy\\n\\n - Poor people are poor because they don't work hard.\\n - Poor people are poor because powerful people with malicious intent are\\n   taking their resources.\\n - Poor people are poor because our economy makes it hard to increase your net\\n   worth.\\n\\n\\n### Education\\n\\n - Girls and boys have inherent (from birth) differences in what topics they\\n   are interested in, and therefore end up finding careers in.\\n - Girls and boys have the same chance to become interested in something at\\n   birth, but are unevenly distributed in careers due to how they are raised.\\n\\nMore theories like this that were widely believed but are now disproven can be\\nfound on [this Wikipedia\\npage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_theories_in_science).\\nAlso [this study of medical\\ntherapies](https://twitter.com/kevinnbass/status/1184599630312427520).\\n\\nNote that some stories can be completely true, but still not have the effect\\nthey imply.\\nFor instance, certain foods contain toxins that kill and/or mutate our cells.\\nBut this does not mean that we shouldn't eat those foods (perhaps every food\\nfalls into this category?).\\n\\nSee https://superbowl.substack.com/p/causal-explanations-considered-harmful for\\na good exploration of misleading causal theories.\\n\\nFor each of the above statements/stories, there are groups of people who would\\nfind them plausible.\\nSince some directly contradict each other, how are we to know which to believe?\\n\\n\\n## The Scientific Method\\n\\nWe can use scientific reasoning to falsify inaccurate stories!\\nIdeally, we would do this for all information we incorporate into our decisions;\\nif no one has tried to falsify a certain piece of information, then we probably\\nshouldn't use it for important decision making.\\n\\nUnfortunately, science is really hard, so many falsification studies have not\\nbeen done.\\nAdditionally, science doesn't give hard yes-or-no answers - it gives\\nprobabilities (e.g. p-values) that something might be true given a long list of\\nassumptions or constraints.\\nContext is crucially important - studies generally are very narrow in the\\nsituations they apply to!\\nIn order to accurately incorporate a scientific finding into a justification for\\nmaking a certain decision, the uncertainties in the study and the required\\ncontext to apply it should be understood.\\n\\nOh yeah, also scientific studies can just be wrong due to errors in their\\nexecution, even if the experimenters themselves were unbiased.\\nA good practical way to get around this problem is to [read review articles\\ninstead of individual\\nstudies](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/).\\n\\nIt is hard to do this, just like it is hard to come up with scientific findings\\nin the first place.\\nIf we as a society deeply recognized this difficulty, it may give more respect\\nto good scientific findings, and help us have more informed debated about what\\nactions to take on big important issues.\\nThis recognition may also make people more patient and willing to embrace the\\ndifficulty, instead of looking for shortcuts.\\n\\n(I have nothing against finding the most efficient ways to solve problems,\\nexcept when these shortcuts are less rigorous or otherwise worse than harder\\nsolutions AND we pretend that they are just as good just because of their\\nconvenience).\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\n - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper\\n - \\\"The Beginning of Infinity\\\" by David Deutsch\\n\\n\\n## People and Stories\\n\\nWhen it comes to deciding what stories are accurate, or worth etching deeply\\ninto your own mind, it is important to select stories which have had a lot of\\neffort put towards their falsification, but still hold up.\\nTo verify this process, it is ideal to try your hardest to falsify the story in\\nquestion yourself.\\n\\nLooking at what others believe is a good way to find new stories, and also can\\nbe a good way to vet stories.\\nIt is crucial however to think about WHY believers trust the stories they do.\\nIf they have not actively tried to falsify their own stories, that is a red flag\\nthat their belief may not be sound.\\nEvidence that people have tried this falsification includes:\\n\\n - Advertisement of conditions under which their story does not hold true.\\n - Write ups of experiments that were done in the effort of falsification.\\n\\nAt a higher level, if the person in question has a history of changing their\\nbeliefs when shown new evidence, that is also a good sign.\\n\\nFor those people who have a long history of believing the same story, or have\\nfinancial or social incentives to believe said story, be wary that their\\nconfirmation bias may blind them a bit to new information.\\n\\nIn extreme cases, people who do not try to falsify their own stories can become\\nzealots; so blind to the limitation of their own beliefs that there is no\\npractical difference between them and someone who is intentionally promoting a\\nbelief they know to be wrong (lying).\\n\\nOne thing to note is that people holding hard to old beliefs seems to be a\\nnatural thing for humans to do, and there are ways to exploit this without\\nchanging people's minds: \\n\\n - [VSauce reasoning video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ArVh3Cj9rw)_\\n - [Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile) discusses how it\\n   might be ideal to have many strongly supported ideas fight it out in e.g. a\\n   market to find the best ones and move the whole system forward optimally.\\n\\nThis is related to the idea of \\\"science advances one funeral at a time\\\", which\\nassumes that (1) famous accomplished sciences direct future research and (2)\\nthese scientists have entrenched beliefs.\\nThese things combined mean new research directions that do not fit into the\\nbeliefs of the accomplished scientists do not get funding/attention.\\nIt would be nice if this wasn't as true, but at the least there is still\\nadvancement \\\\*shrug\\\\*.\\n\\nSee also the [\\\"Self Deception\\\" section of _Perspective_]({{\u003c relref\\n\\\"/docs/mind/perspective.md\\\" \u003e}}#Self-Deception).\\n\\n### Reasons People Share Ideas\\n\\nThinking about why an idea is being shared might make your decision of whether\\nto believe it or not easier.\\nNote that all of these reasons are extremely important and enable our modern\\nsociety; I'm not saying that if you are listening to e.g. an advocate you can\\njust ignore everything they are saying.\\n\\n - **Truth Sharing**: Simply to share the truth to others, for them to do what\\n   they will with it. This type of sharing happens a lot in dense academic\\n   research papers that effectively just share numbers and contain very little\\n   interpretation.  It's easy to think you are doing this when you actually\\n   aren't. Examples:\\n    - Michael Lustgarten's YouTube Channel\\n - **Advocacy**: To change the behavior of others. For instance, sharing\\n   pictures of smoker's lungs to get people to stop smoking. Or to get atheists\\n   to accept God.\\n    - Public health initiatives\\n    - COVID vaccine advertisements\\n - **Brainstorming/Theorizing**: To get others to think about a problem or\\n   model of the world that might be useful or inaccurate. Partially in the\\n   hopes that others will find the model useful, and partially in the hopes\\n   that others will improve or soundly reject the model.\\n    - [\\\"Why Greatness Cannot be Planned\\\" by Kenneth O.

For instance a self-taught woodworker will eventually learn how to\\ncreate complex wooden structures based on past experience of how wood behaves\\nwhen he or she does things to it.  Or a chess player may learn that certain\\npatterns of pieces are dangerous or safe over time after winning or losing many\\ngames.\\n\\nInformation derived from tinkerers is:\\n\\n - Often very practically useful\\n - Rarely completely \\\"wrong\\\", just maybe only right in a very narrow scope.\\n\\nBut has these problems:\\n\\n - Deeper theories or reasons behind why the information is what it is are\\n   often absent or unrecoverable.  This limits the scope at which the\\n   information can be accurately applied.\\n - Reproducing the logic behind the information can be very difficult or\\n   impossible, since it requires walking though the life experience of the\\n   tinkerer.

  Solving Societal Problems
  <a class="anchor" href="#solving-societal-problems">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m defining a &ldquo;societal problem&rdquo; as a large problem facing many people
that could be solved if said people changed their behavior in some systematic
way. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate Change</strong> could be solved if we all transitioned to using more
renewable sources of energy.</li>
<li>The <strong>Obesity Epidemic</strong> could be solved if we all ate less food.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="individual-change-and-shaming">
  Individual Change and Shaming
  <a class="anchor" href="#individual-change-and-shaming">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One common proposal I&rsquo;ve heard for solving at least the above problems is using
a &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; approach. This method would involve first changing your own
behavior such that the problem would be solved if everyone behaved like you,
then trying to influence others to adopt your new behavior(s). This seems
simple enough, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the best way forward, and in some ways is
actively harmful.</p>
<p>The tacit assumption with this proposal is that people are able to choose what
behaviors to adopt. I would argue that in fact our behaviors are much more
influenced by our environment than we would like to admit. One component of our
environment is indeed other people peer pressuring us, but (IMO) far more
dominant factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economics (how much the behavior change costs)</li>
<li>&ldquo;At hand&rdquo;-ness (what other behaviors are &ldquo;at hand&rdquo; and easy to do)</li>
</ul>
<p>When these factors are overpowering (which I argue they usually are), peer
pressure becomes a form of bullying and social rejection that the target of
which is powerless to stop. Perpetuating this is downright cruel.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-environment">
  Changing the Environment
  <a class="anchor" href="#changing-the-environment">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If a grassroots behavior change movement isn&rsquo;t the best way to solve the
problem, then what can we do instead?  In my opinion, the answer is
environmental change. This can take several forms:</p>
<h3 id="1-local-environmental-change">
  1. Local Environmental Change
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-local-environmental-change">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This involves making changes to an individual&rsquo;s local environment (the spaces
they interact with on a habitual basis) to guide them to certain behaviors.
Some examples would be intentionally not buying unhealthy food when at the
grocery store so that when at home these foods are not &ldquo;at hand&rdquo;. Or not buying
a car so that you instead need to bike or bus to get around.</p>
<p>Note that the line here can be pretty blurry between what is an actual behavior
change and what is simply an action that changes one&rsquo;s environment. Because of
this, I think the stronger, ultimate solution is:</p>
<h3 id="2-policy-level-environmental-change">
  2. Policy-Level Environmental Change
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-policy-level-environmental-change">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Government policies can create massive environmental changes. For example,
extra taxes on certain products can massively impact people&rsquo;s buying decisions.
Or bans of certain products can completely change the suite of chemicals that
individuals are exposed to on a daily basis.</p>
<p>A natural objection is to point out that in a democracy, the majority of people
(in theory) choose what policies are enacted. Because of this, wouldn&rsquo;t people
just vote for policies that help them perpetuate their current behavior set -
which they presumably &ldquo;chose&rdquo; and/or otherwise would like to keep?</p>
<p>I argue that actually <strong>people are quite able to vote in a way counter to their
everyday actions</strong>. For instance, people who enjoy soda may vote for a
sugar-sweetened beverage tax. The reason why (I think) this is because the
mental state you adopt when voting is generally different that the mental state
when deciding - or not consciously deciding at all - to engage in a particular
behavior.</p>
<p>This is especially true when voting on higher level, more abstract policies.
For instance, banning a certain type of energy production might indirectly
increase someone&rsquo;s cost of living by quite a bit in various ways, but thinking
about the policy in a more abstract sense may lead someone to approve it
despite this personal impact.</p>
<p>Based on my own emotions, I also think that people by and large care deeply
about how their lives compare to those of others around them.  A tax that
greatly increases everyone&rsquo;s cost of living is much more bearable than one that
targets just an individual person. It&rsquo;s much rarer for people to worry about
their absolute standing than how they compare to others - the fact that the
majority of people today live like the elites of a couple centuries ago is not
a great source of comfort and satisfaction generally speaking.</p>
<p>This, like many solutions to big problems, does depend on an educated populace
that is able to reason about the effects of certain policies. Ensuring this
condition is itself a large scale societal problem that hopefully can be solved
with this same line of thinking. I do admit there&rsquo;s a bit of a chicken-and-egg
problem here :/.</p>
<h4 id="nudging">
  Nudging
  <a class="anchor" href="#nudging">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_%28book%29">Nudge</a> explores one
philosophy with which good policies can be crafted without impinging too much on
individual liberty.</p>
<h4 id="externality-based-policies">
  Externality-based Policies
  <a class="anchor" href="#externality-based-policies">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Many societal problems are due to hard-to-track externalities of existing
behaviors that are not &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; to the cost of the behavior. For instance,
companies that make unhealthy food do not pay for the healthcare costs their
products incur. Or single-use plastic producers do not pay for waste cleanup
efforts. Or petroleum refiners do not pay for CO2 emissions. If these
externalities were priced in, then the consumer would have a much easier time
making buying decisions, as the real cost of their consumption would be obvious
to them.</p>
<p>Currently, it&rsquo;s hard to know the real cost of a given behavior, which is
further confused by emotional arguments on either side. For example, if you
want to know if you should use plastic straws or not, the low price of them
might make you think they are an efficient way to solve your problem. But
others would argue that [some large number] of straws are used every second!
Unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t really tell you very much. If instead it cost a
dollar to clean up every discarded straw, and that was priced into the straws
cost since the producing company had to clean up the straws, then you as the
consumer could make a more informed decision about whether that dollar is worth
it.</p>
<p>Of course, tracking all these externalities is hard. But this seems like a
useful framework, or at least more useful that trying to get consumers to all
individually understand the externalities of their actions.</p>
<p>Probably someone else somewhere has done a much better job exploring this
topic.</p>
<h3 id="3-technological-environmental-change">
  3. Technological Environmental Change
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-technological-environmental-change">#</a>
</h3>
<p>New technologies dramatically change the environment people live in.
Interestingly, they usually do this without requiring the bureaucracy required
to enact government policies. Therefore, the development of new technologies to
solve societal problems, like geoengineering techniques for climate change,
has a lot of potential. And some problems can <strong>only</strong> be solved with new
technologies (like preventing aging).</p>
<h3 id="4-cultural-environmental-change">
  4. Cultural Environmental Change
  <a class="anchor" href="#4-cultural-environmental-change">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Shifting cultural norms also can lead to massive change in individual behavior.
I don&rsquo;t really know the best way this can be leveraged without the &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo;
problem I mentioned above, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.</p>
<h2 id="personal-impact">
  Personal Impact
  <a class="anchor" href="#personal-impact">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Given this theory, if someone feels strongly that certain problems need to be
solves, what should they do?</p>
<p>Influencing government policy is a lot of work and is, I would argue, a task
that requires specialized skills. This means that someone who invests more time
in building these skills will hone them, and have more leverage when applying
them. Therefore, an effective path to personally solving societal problems is
to invest a lot of time and energy in honing and applying these skills. Note
that I&rsquo;m not talking about lobbying here, but rather actually writing laws and
doing the research that motivates their creation and design. This kind of
environment building can also be done outside of formal government in private
organizations that fill some roles that a government might otherwise fill.</p>
<p>Our hypothetical person could also get deep into creating a technology that
solves the problem they care about. This arguably takes even more time/energy
investment to see significant returns.</p>
<p>For those who do not want to, or cannot, invest time/energy in influencing
policy or developing new technologies, one fallback option is to instead hone
another set of skills, apply them to make money, and then fund
policymakers/inventors with the proceeds. This will probably have a bigger
impact than dabbling in invention/policymaking, and certainly will have a
bigger impact than just changing your own behavior.</p>
<p>Regardless, being a <a href="/docs/mind/optimism/">creative optimist (as opposed to a destructive
pessimist)</a> is important.</p>
<h3 id="hypocrisy">
  Hypocrisy
  <a class="anchor" href="#hypocrisy">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If you assume that &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; individual change has little to no impact on
societal problems, then a lot of seemly hypocritical behavior is explained and
even excused. For instance, it is very reasonable to believe strongly that
society would be better if everyone was vegan, while eating the readily
available non-vegan foods provided by society. It even makes some sense that
someone super passionate about some political issue - to the point where they
organize protests or voting campaigns - may not vote for the issue themselves!
In my opinion, these behaviors are more a demonstration of how these
hypothetical people think they can manifest change as opposed to what they
truly believe.</p>
<h2 id="testing-this-theory">
  Testing this Theory
  <a class="anchor" href="#testing-this-theory">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Right now this line of thinking is just a plausible (at least to me) idea.  I
would love to see some evidence for this, but don&rsquo;t have any at hand right now
to cite.  So (as always) I might be totally wrong :).</p>
