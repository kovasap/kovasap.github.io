attention must be focused on a single thing to avoid failure, leading to an emptiness of other thoughts.\\n\\n\\n## Chaos to Solution\\n\\nThe feeling when you have no idea how to fix something but suddenly a solution appears out of nowhere. You may or may not understand how the solution works or where it came from.\\n\\n\\n## Constructive regret\\n\\nThe feeling when you step out of a test and think 'I knew that answer!!' in a way that makes you want to walk right back into the testing hall and fix your mistake.\\n\\n\\n## Discovery of hidden gems\\n\\nMost of the time this activity is monotonous and/or forgettable, but occasionally it will yield an extremely memorable or life-changing experience.\\n\\n\\n## Easy to do\\n\\nRequires little to no difficult decision making, so is therefore easy to pick up and do. This can lead to impulsively doing this thing too much.\\n\\n\\n## False Understanding\\n\\nA state of mind where something seems to make sense emotionally, but if you were to try to explain it in your own words or otherwise apply the knowledge you would fail.\\n\\n\\n## Financial Control\\n\\nA feeling that you understand and are in control of your finances.\\n\\n  - positive\\n\\n## Fitting puzzle pieces together\\n\\nThe feeling of finding the right place for a part of something you are building.\\n\\n\\n## Focus fragmenting\\n\\nThe feeling of constantly having your focus redirected, preventing you from going deeper on any one particular thing.\\n\\n\\n## Having a clear goal\\n\\nThe feeling of knowing exactly what you need to do.\\n\\n\\n## Joy of sharing\\n\\nThe feeling you get when you find something cool and share it with someone else.\\n\\n\\n## Pride of Construction\\n\\nFeeling proud or even in awe of something you made that is now a (semi) permenant thing in the world. \\n\\n  - positive\\n\\n## Reactive Randomness Stress\\n\\nCommitting a decision and then bracing yourself for bad things to happen based on some probability which you cannot stop (since you have already committed).\\n\\n\\n## Relaxing\\n\\nFeeling comfortable and liable to zone out.\\n\\n  - positive\\n\\n## Scanning through possibilities\\n\\nConstantly examining many options and determining the best one by some usually simple criteria.\\n\\n  - engaging\\n\\n## Skill clicking into place\\n\\nThe feeling when something that you thought was impossible, or otherwise had no idea how to even approach doing, you can suddenly do effortlessly.\\n\\n\\n## Thrill of Committment\\n\\nDoing something with a penalty for failure that you can't turn back from.\\n\\n\\n## Triumph over Exposure\\n\\nPutting yourself in a stressful situation and showing yourself that you can survive in it. I think this is a feeling Marc-Andr\u00e9 Leclerc was chasing in the movie 'The Alpinist'.\\n\\n\\n## Wonder\\n\\nA sense of wonder at the beauty of the world.\\n\\nCategories: \"\n    :name \"feelings.md\"\n    :categories #{}\n    :dir? false\n    :links []\n    :size 2764\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 420}\n   {:path \"content/docs/manifesto.md\"\n    :title \"Manifesto\"\n    :markdown \"# Personal Manifesto\\n\\nI aspire to be a **vigorous** and **wise** person that feels **empowered** to\\nboth help myself and others become more vigorous and wise.\\n\\n## Personal Characteristics\\n\\n### Vigor\\n\\nEnergy to achieve goals in my experience comes from two main sources:\\n\\n**Physical Health**: [Exercise]({{< relref\\n\\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/exercise.md\\\" >}}), [sleep]({{< relref\\n\\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/sleep.md\\\" >}}), [food]({{< relref\\n\\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/food.md\\\" >}}), [cronic stress]({{< relref\\n\\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/chronic-stress.md\\\" >}}), [circadian rhythm]({{<\\nrelref \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/circadian-rhythm.md\\\" >}}), and other\\nenvironmental influences all effect personal vigor in complex and\\ninter-dependant ways.  Spending time untangling this web of interactions for\\noneself is a worthy endeavor that has personally helped me feel more\\nconsistently energetic.  Also a deeper understanding of these interactions will\\nprobably make you live longer!\\n\\n**Vision**: Vision is a clear path for how to achieve the goal in question, or\\nat least for how to get closer to achieving said goal.  Acquiring vision can be\\ntricky and fickle.  For me, it helps to:\\n\\n - Somewhat aimlessly learn about the area of knowledge the goal is in by\\n   reading what other people have written/said about it.  Sometimes reading\\n   about even completely unrelated topics can spark ideas about the original\\n   goal. Audiobooks and podcasts are great for getting this exposure.\\n - Plant \\\"seeds\\\" in my head relating to the goal.  These usually manifest as\\n   questions I'm curious to know the answers to, or very rough theories that I\\n   can't even put into words for how the goals might be achieved.\\n - Sleep on my knowledge to find new connections and/or grow the seeds (see\\n   [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)).\\n - Do cardiovascular exercise like hiking or running to find new connections\\n   and/or help grow the seeds.  Not sure how this helps (more blood flow to the\\n   brain?), but it usually does for me.\\n - Take a long break from the goal and work on another goal.  Having multiple\\n   in-flight projects at once makes this more natural.\\n - Set up my environment and habits so that I am consistently exposed to the\\n   goal, making it more likely my thoughts will wander to it and make progress\\n   decoding it.\\n - See also [creativity]({{< relref \\\"/docs/mind/creativity.md\\\" >}}) (maybe I\\n   should merge these sections).\\n\\n### Wisdom\\n\\nWisdom to me means a relative lack of surprise with the behavior of the world\\naround oneself.  By this definition, to become wise is to build an effective\\nmodel of the world in one's head that can predict what will happen\\nconsistently, thus avoiding surprise.  Because the world is often\\nunpredictable, wisdom also means not expecting things of the world that cannot\\nbe expected.  For example, there are many catastrophes that could happen at any\\nmoment, causing severe damage to one's life - handling these with grace as\\nopposed to feeling the negative emotions that come with unmet expectations is\\nperhaps wise.\\n\\nThis is discussed in a lot more detail by [Stoic\\nphilosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).  My reading of this work\\nis that the universe behaves logically and the better one understands this\\nuniversal reason (logos), the more in harmony with the universe one will be.\\n\\nWisdom also means recognizing that attaining accurate knowledge is often\\npainstaking work, and therefore to be wise is to be patient with learning and\\nnot try to take shortcuts when understanding the truth is important.  See [What\\nto believe]({{< relref \\\"/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe.md\\\" >}})\\nfor discussion of this.\\n\\nWisdom may be related to a well developed \\\"System 1\\\" as described in\\n[_Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel\\nKahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).\\n\\nOne danger with chasing wisdom is believing that all the time you've spend\\n\\\"getting wiser\\\" by thinking justifies confident snap-opinions on new issues.\\nBuilding models to understand the world requires abstraction, and abstract\\nmodels never perfectly fit new concrete situations. In my opinion recognizing\\nthis limitation, and being willing to put in the work of describing and\\nmodelling the new situation is itself wise. This is highly related to the\\nconcept of [Beginner's Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), which IMO\\nit is wise to cultivate, as opposed to an \\\"expert's mind\\\".\\n\\nRealizing that human knowledge is fallible, but also objectively meaningful and\\nthe accumulation of it makes one objectively wiser is discussed in detail in\\n[The Beginning of\\nInfinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity) by David\\nDeutsch. \\n\\nIn practice, wisdom naturally leads to well-roundedness:\\n\\n#### Well-Roundedness\\n\\nBeing well rounded to me means having a wide range of capabilities.  This has\\nseveral strong benefits:\\n\\n - It reduces single points of failure in life (e.g. injuries or big life\\n   changes leaving one without a purpose/focus).\\n - It makes moments where the world is negatively effecting one in a way which\\n   they are powerless to stop rarer, since it is more likely one will have the\\n   skills necessary to redirect or counter the negative effect.\\n - It makes you more socially interesting to a wider range of different people.\\n   People find capability in specific areas interesting, so more capability in\\n   more areas should make you more interesting to more people.\\n - It allows one to notice and act on more opportunities in life, since most\\n   require some knowledge in their area to detect and exploit. I think it's\\n   reasonable to say that ones ability to discover and make the most of\\n   opportunities has massive impact on the trajectory of ones life.\\n - It hastens learning of new skills and concepts, which often have\\n   similarities to other skills/concepts.  The more you have command of, the\\n   more likely it is that there will be commonalities between the new\\n   skill/concept and one you already know. Also, it can help build abstract\\n   mental concepts by consciously identifying these commonalities and storing\\n   them as a new abstract concept.\\n - It enables formation of novel ideas, which are often just ideas from one\\n   discipline applied to another.\\n\\nOne way to describe this value is as an aspiration to being a [\\\"Renaissance\\nman\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) (See\\n[ERE](https://wiki.earlyretirementextreme.com/wiki/What_is_ERE%3F) for more\\ndiscussion of this.\\n\\nBecoming more well rounded is mostly achieved (in my experience) by seeing\\nroadblocks in life as personal opportunities for growth. Energetically owning\\nand tackling these roadblocks will lead to learning the best ways to get around\\nthem, improving one's breath of knowledge and making similar issues one might\\nencounter later easier to navigate.\\n\\nThe \\\"I can do this\\\" or \\\"I can learn how to do this\\\" sentiment when faced with\\nany issue should lead to an increase in well-roundedness over time.\\n\\nSome areas of knowledge to consider personally deeply understanding to become\\nmore well rounded + tasks to try:\\n\\n - Repair/construction of objects you depend on - try fixing your\\n   computer/cloths/furniture/bike/car/house.\\n - Investing savings - try researching, creating, and executing a personal\\n   investment plan yourself.\\n - Food production - try growing/cooking your own food.\\n\\n## Empowerment\\n\\nTo me, personal empowerment is about leveraging vigor and wisdom to achieve\\ngoals.  Empowerment and motivation are near synonyms to me.  Good environment\\nand expectations dramatically help keep up motivation/empowerment.\\n\\nTODO: Merge this with [motivation]({{< relref \\\"/docs/mind/motivation.md\\\" >}}).\\n\\n### Environment\\n\\nA large chuck of my brain does things in response to environmental stimuli. If\\nI see tasty food, part of my brain will want to eat it. If I am too hot or\\ncold, part of my brain will make a fuss. If I'm with other people, part of my\\nbrain will want to impress or entertain them. \\n\\nBecause of this, crafting an environment that encourages healthy behaviors that\\nhelp you achieve personal goals is really important. I [agree with James\\nClear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) that it is foolish to think your\\nconscious mind can muscle its way past all the other parts that manage\\nenvironmental stimuli to reach its goals.\\n\\nIt's easy to get swept up in life and let your behavior be dictated by your\\nenvironment (e.g. what others around you are doing).\\n\\nIt's dangerous to do this since your environment is not a sentient being and\\ntherefore does not care about anything, let alone your personal\\nhappiness/satisfaction/fulfillment.\\n\\nIt's worth taking a step back and consciously running through whether you agree\\nwith your environment's influence or not frequently.  Otherwise you might end\\nup less happy/satisfied/fulfilled than you might otherwise be.\\n\\nDoing this takes time and energy.  Therefore, if you want to live more\\nintentionally, it is important to give yourself that space/energy and not fill\\nit with other things.\\n\\nOne common and strong environmental force is momentum. It is easier to continue\\ndoing something you are already doing than to switch tasks. This can be used to\\nhelp complete less pleasurable tasks (finishing homework or a workout), but\\nalso can make you continue doing an activity past the point of it's benefit to\\nyou.  Examples of this for me include: eating after already full, playing a\\ngame to the point of frustration, and continuing to browse Reddit or YouTube\\nwithout feeling inspired about what I find. Stopping and checking yourself in\\nthese situations with this idea in mind can help you switch tasks to something\\nthat will be a better overall use of time.  I have a pet theory that your brain\\ngets specifically tired with particular tasks after a couple hours of doing\\nthem, and switching at this point to another task often uses enough different\\nparts of your brain to make you feel very fresh in the new context.\\n\\n\\n### Expectations\\n\\nTODO: fill this in (potentially from the \\\"motivation\\\" doc)\\n\\nCategories: \"\n    :name \"manifesto.md\"\n    :categories #{}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/health-and-longevity/exercise.md\"\n            \"/docs/health-and-longevity/sleep.md\"\n            \"/docs/health-and-longevity/food.md\"\n            \"/docs/health-and-longevity/chronic-stress.md\"\n            \"/docs/health-and-longevity/circadian-rhythm.md\"\n            \"/docs/mind/creativity.md\"\n            \"/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe.md\"\n            \"/docs/mind/motivation.md\"]\n    :size 10087\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/climbing/breaking-point.md\"\n    :title \"Breaking Point\"\n    :markdown \"# Physical \\\"Breaking Point\\\"\\n\\nOne interesting thing I've noticed about myself as I progress through a\\nclimbing session is that my ability degradation due to tiredness is not linear,\\nor really consistent at all.

This book makes the strong point that human beings are not inherently\\nperfectly disciplined, and will inevitably cut corners when doing a task many\\ntimes.  This is especially true when the corners that are cut are usually not\\nimportant, even if sometimes they are crucially so.\\n\\nReading this made me think of the process of climbing, which has many such\\nsteps.  So, in the interest of not skipping these steps myself, here is my\\nattempt at a *Manifesto* style checklist.  As in the book, I tried to make this\\nchecklist as useful and evidence driven as possible.  I'm hoping to make it\\nshort enough to be usable, yet not skipping any steps that commonly lead to\\ninjuries/death.\\n\\nBefore writing the checklist, I wanted to get an idea of what mistakes most\\ncommonly cause injuries when climbing.  According to [The epidemiology of\\nmountaineering and rock climbing\\naccidents](https://doi.org/10.1580/0953-9859-1.4.235), in Grand Teton National\\nPark from 1981 to 1986 these were:\\n\\n * Bad fall, usually on lead (34 cases).\\n * Rock fall when climbing (11 cases).\\n * Getting lost off route (6 cases).\\n * Rappelling off the rope end (1 case).\\n * Rappelling with a bad anchor (2 cases).\\n * Not using proper protection (7 cases).\\n * Not using a rope (4 cases)!\\n * Not wearing a helmet (3 cases).\\n\\nMost of the injuries discussed in the paper happened on snow/ice, which I'm\\nignoring for the purposes of this checklist.\\n\\nInterestingly, most of these injuries occurred on the easiest routes (5.1-5.3!),\\nwhich is in line with most of the anecdotes in *The Checklist Manifesto*.\\n\\nAnother study, [\\\"Rock climbing rescues in Boulder County, Colorado and Eldorado\\nCanyon State\\nPark\\\"](https://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(12)00109-3/fulltext), has\\nsimilar statistics.

The\\nnext couple rappels were very straightforward, until we got to pitch 3. \\n\\n![Rappel Corner](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/rappel-corner-pitch.jpg)\\n\\nFirstly, this pitch was very long to rappel.  I remember having to daisy-chain\\nsome quickdraws together in order to keep a hold of both rope ends, but still\\ncouldn't make it all the way to the anchors.  Instead I had to stop at this\\ntree with a sling around it (perhaps others had the same issue).\\n\\n![Up Pitch 3](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/up-pitch-3.jpg)\\n\\nOnce Matthew had also rappelled down, we decided to pull the rope through and\\nbelay each other off the tree as we walked down to the ~20ft away anchors.\\nThis is where we ran into another snag:\\n\\nSo far, I had been rappelling down the climb with this technique:\\n\\n![GriGri Rappel](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/grigri-rappel.jpg)\\n*Image source: https://ropeandsummit.wordpress.com/technique/belaying-rappeling/*\\n\\nThis allowed me to use my GriGri for a more comfortable and safer rappel.\\nUnfortunately, this method had the before unforseen drawback of making it much\\neasier for the rope to get stuck in constrictions when pulling it through.\\nThis is exactly what happened when pulling our rope through on this pitch.  Our\\nknot got stuck about 5 feet from the upper anchor, and no amount of wiggling\\nand pulling would set it free!\\n\\nVery very luckily, the other end of the rope was still in reach.  I was able to\\ngrab it, pull it down, attach my GriGri, and then part climb/part jug up the\\nwhole climb back to the anchors.  I noticed a clear spot where the knot had\\ngotten stuck.  I am extremely grateful that this spot was not further down the\\nclimb; had we not been able to use the other rope end to climb up we would have\\nbeen very stuck.  I then set up a more traditional rappel, rappelled down, and\\npulled the rope with no issues.\\n\\nThis extra \\\"climb\\\" burned even more time, and now we were very eager to make a\\nhasty descent.  We quickly finished the rest of our rappels and started\\nscrambling back to the trail over the talus fields.\\n\\n![Looking Back](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/looking-back.jpg)\\n\\nBy the time we had reached the trail proper, the sun was already (beautifully)\\nsetting.\\n\\n![Sunset](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/sunset.jpg)\\n\\nWith the solid trail beneath our feet, we started moving faster, breaking\\nalmost into a jog as the trail got flatter.  On the way down, we passed a very\\ntired, but very chilled out family hiking up on a backpacking trip.  Their\\ncalming influence was very welcome.\\n\\nOnce we had made it into the forest, we had to pull out our phone flashlights,\\nas it was now completely dark.  We managed to do this part of the trail in\\nrecord time, only getting lost a bit on the largest river crossing.  Luckily we\\nwere both able to quickly retrace our steps and re-locate the trail on the\\nother side of the river without too much more time.\\n\\nWe got to the car around 9:30pm and drove as quickly as we could to get back to\\nour campsite just after they closed at 10pm.  The gatekeeper took pity on us\\nand let us in without a fine or any other trouble.  Our fellow campers were\\npretty worried about us though.  Reflecting back on our botch rappel this trip\\nmade me realize that I really want to either have cell service or a satellite\\ncommunication device the next time I go on a trip like this.\\n\\nBesides our rushed finish, this climb was truly spectacular. It was also a\\ngreat sport -> alpine climbing introduction.  I wouldn't go so far as to call\\nit \\\"pleasure climbing\\\" like a roped soloer we met two days before at Mt. Erie\\ncalled it, but it was a really cool alpine climbing experience.  Just make sure\\nyou give yourself enough time!\\n\\n![Matthew Looking Back](/docs/climbing/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club-pics/matthew-looking-back.jpg)\\n\\nCategories: [Climbing]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Climbing=true), [Event Reports]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Event-Reports=true)\"\n    :name \"2020-8-12-mile-high-club.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Climbing\"\n                  \"Event Reports\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Climbing=true), [Event Reports]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 10797\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/climbing/event-reports/first-512.md\"\n    :title \"First 512\"\n    :markdown \"# My First 5.12!\\n\\nI projected this route for a while and still can remember its movements.\\nPosting it here mostly for my own personal nostalgia : ).\\n\\nHere is the route: https://photos.app.goo.gl/fvva4kiMPeRbi6tP9.\\n\\nCategories: [Climbing]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Climbing=true), [Event Reports]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Event-Reports=true)\"\n    :name \"first-512.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Climbing\"\n                  \"Event Reports\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Climbing=true), [Event Reports]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 349\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/datavis/reddit-tree.md\"\n    :title \"Reddit Tree\"\n    :markdown \"# Reddit Comment Tree\\n\\nI was curious about which Reddit comments end up getting many upvotes, so I\\nmade this visualization:\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <a href=\\\"/reddit-tree.html\\\">\\n    <img src=\\\"/docs/datavis/reddit-tree.png\\\" alt=\\\"reddit tree\\\"/>\\n  </a>\\n  <figcaption><small>Click the image to go to the interactive page!</small></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<!--\\n<iframe src=\\\"/reddit-tree.html\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"100%\\\" style=\\\"border:none;\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe>\\n-->\\n\\nThe code can be found at\\n[github.com/kovasap/reddit-tree](https://github.com/kovasap/reddit-tree).\\n\\n## Related\\n\\n - [Map of Reddit](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/), an amazing\\n   visualization of all subreddits and how they are related (by user activity).\\n\\nCategories: [Datavis]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Datavis=true)\"\n    :name \"reddit-tree.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Datavis\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 782\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/datavis/seattle-rain.md\"\n    :title \"Seattle Rain\"\n    :markdown \"---\\nplotly: true\\n---\\n\\n# Rain in Seattle\\n\\nAs I've experience Seattle weather day to day, my mind has come up with random\\ntheories for periods of the day (morning, afternoon) when it rains the\\nmost/least.

Dodging the rain is really nice when possible so that I don't get as wet\\non the way to work.\\n\\n**Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much correlation at all with time of\\nday and precipitation.** Read on to see how I discovered this...\\n\\n## Data\\n\\nI thought I'd try answering the question once and for all by looking at some\\nweather station data.  I first tried getting data via this service:\\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets.  Unfortunately, the data I got was\\npretty inconsistent. I talked to a meteorologist from NOAA via their help email\\nand was redirected to some [beta\\ndata](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/hpd/auto/v2/beta/15min/). For this\\ndata, I needed to pick a station, so I looked in the `hpd-stations-inventory`\\nfile and found a list of Washington stations with coordinates. I loaded these\\nup using [Google Maps](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/102780) and found\\nthat the Everett station was the closest one to Seattle (there was no station\\nin Seattle proper \ud83d\ude41). Then I found and downloaded the file corresponding to\\nthis station ID (USC00452675).\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\nI analyzed the data using plotly with [this\\ncode](https://github.com/kovasap/weather-data). This code calculates the\\nprobability that it will rain in all the historical data during any given\\n15-minute interval and plots that number, with error bars given as the standard\\ndeviation.  I first did data from 2019-2021 for speed of processing...\\n\\n{{< plotly json=\\\"/USC00452675.15m.2019-2021.csv.json\\\" height=\\\"1800px\\\" >}}\\n\\n...and I saw some trends! Especially in August and July it looked like it\\ndidn't ever rain in the afternoon. This got me excited to think I'd learned\\nsomething, so I ran with more data (2000-2021)...\\n\\n{{< plotly json=\\\"/USC00452675.15m.2000-2021.csv.json\\\" height=\\\"1800px\\\" >}}\\n\\n...and everything averaged out \ud83d\ude26. \\n\\nCategories: [Datavis]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Datavis=true)\"\n    :name \"seattle-rain.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Datavis\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 2171\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/experiences/Age-of-Darkness:-Final-Stand.md\"\n    :title \"Age Of Darkness: Final Stand\"\n    :markdown \"#[Age of Darkness: Final Stand](https://www.ageofdarkness.com/)\\n\\nA real-time-with-pause strategy game with excellent art. \\n\\nFeelings: \\n\\n  - [Fitting puzzle pieces together]({{< relref \\\"/docs/feelings.md\\\" >}}#fitting-puzzle-pieces-together)\\n\\nCategories: [Experiences]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Experiences=true), [Game]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Game=true), [Solitary]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Solitary=true)\"\n    :name \"Age-of-Darkness:-Final-Stand.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Experiences\"\n                  \"Game\"\n                  \"Solitary\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/feelings.md\"\n            \"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Experiences=true), [Game]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Game=true), [Solitary]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 420\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 420}\n   {:path \"content/docs/experiences/Apex-Legends.md\"\n    :title \"Apex Legends\"\n    :markdown \"#Apex Legends\\n\\nA fast-paced first person shooter video game.

Unfortunately, the randomness in this game will lead to characters dying, so if you want to preserve specific characters get ready to save and load a lot :). This game is pretty hard and doesn't necessarily give you direct feedback as to why you are failing. The combat uses randomness pretty heavily to determine hit/miss/crit (head hit) chance, which means that the consequences of your actions are 'fuzzed' - good decisions will sometimes be punished, and bad ones you will sometimes get away with.

This game does a great job of letting you customize your character abilities with a lot of depth, but still with enough constraints to not make every character feel the same. Then, it makes the encounters in the main story difficult, but allows you to level up your characters in 'patrol' side-encounters in case the way you built your characters was not optimal for the main story.

Fair warning though that this gamemay be on this list mostly because of nostalgia.One aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the process of building yourparty over time and making sure you train the right characters. It's verysatisfying to help a weaker character finish enemies to get experience with thegoal of making them a core part of your team composition later on. This isoften fairly difficult - since the characters are weaker after all - which onlyadds to the satisfaction when you pull it off.Another cool mechanic in FE is building supports between characters. When twocharacters fight side by side they will over time build a relationship, whichleads to little dialogue bites. It's satisfying to discover these as you playthrough the game.Both training weaker units and building supports are examples of'meta-challenges' in FE; they aren't required to finish the games, but give youself-directed and sometimes difficult optional objectives during the battles.Because these challenges are self directed they make me feel like I amexpressing myself more as a player, which makes the game feel more interestingthan if I was just solving the same battle puzzles as everyone else.\\n\\nFeelings: \\n\\n\\n\\nCategories: [Experiences]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Experiences=true), [Game]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Game=true), [Solitary]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Solitary=true), [Story]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Story=true), [Turn Based]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Turn-Based=true), [\u2b50top10]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?\u2b50top10=true)\"\n    :name \"Fire-Emblem-7-&-8.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Experiences\"\n                  \"Game\"\n                  \"Solitary\"\n                  \"Story\"\n                  \"Turn Based\"\n                  \"\u2b50top10\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Experiences=true), [Game]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Game=true), [Solitary]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Solitary=true), [Story]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Story=true), [Turn Based]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Turn-Based=true), [\u2b50top10]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 1834\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 420}\n   {:path \"content/docs/experiences/Iron-Danger.md\"\n    :title \"Iron Danger\"\n    :markdown \"#[Iron Danger](https://store.steampowered.com/app/899310/Iron_Danger/)\\n\\nReally cool strategy game with a cool story.

Everymovement made in this game produces audible sound, meaning that movement givesaway your position and makes you vulnerable. However, like in most shooters,if you proactively move to shoot at a particular point, you will still have anadvantage against someone reacting to your movement. This leads to a dynamicwhere both you and your opponent are trying to determine the location of theother without giving away their own location - once one person knows withcertainty they can simply move to attack and will have a strong advantage.This dynamic is framed by the asymmetric nature of all game modes, which haveattacking and defending sides. Attackers must move to engage the defenders,meaning that they start out disadvantaged (they are moving and making noisewhile defenders are not). To counter this, attackers all have remote controldrones that make noise when they move around. These are easily destroyed, butcan be used to determine the locations of defenders, giving attackersadvantage.\\n\\nFeelings: \\n\\n\\n\\nCategories: [Competitive]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Competitive=true), [Experiences]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Experiences=true), [Game]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Game=true)\"\n    :name \"Rainbow-6:-Siege.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Competitive\"\n                  \"Experiences\"\n                  \"Game\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Competitive=true), [Experiences]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Experiences=true), [Game]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 1283\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 420}\n   {:path \"content/docs/experiences/Redditing.md\"\n    :title \"Redditing\"\n    :markdown \"#Redditing\\n\\nBrowsing reddit.

Then everyone just makes the agreed\\nupon move. This effectively turns a \\\"multiplayer\\\" game into a complex \\\"single\\nplayer\\\" experience, where the single player is a group trying to come to\\nconsensus.\\n\\nThis is not in-itself a problem, but it does lead to some issues:\\n\\n - Often a few people end up leading the group, and effectively playing the\\n   game for everyone else.\\n - If leaders don't emerge, it takes a lot of time to get everyone on the same\\n   page about a specific plan of action, which can make the game tedious.\\n\\n## Solution: Communication Limiting\\n\\nAn elegant solution to the above problem (which I haven't tried yet), is to put\\nconstraints on the communication that can be done between players during the\\ngame.  Some ways of doing this include:\\n\\n - Only letting players controlling characters that are physically close\\n   together on the board to speak to each other. This is very easily done with\\n   chat apps (Discord, SMS, etc.).\\n - Putting a time limit (or character limit) on communication. If the limit is\\n   exceeded, then the players will lose turns - their characters were spending\\n   time talking instead of acting.\\n\\nThese options are interesting because they produce a trade off - is it better\\nfor our actions to be more in sync, or should we just act with less\\nsynchronization?\\n\\nGame mechanics could also play into this communication limitation - for\\ninstance, characters that can communicate telepathically with others may be\\nimmune to any limits.\\n\\n\\n## Comments from coworker to integrate\\n\\nI guess you might break it up into a few more parts\\n* Permission (can I talk to this person at all)\\n* Duration (how much time can I communicate with this person)\\n* Dictionary-space (how much vocabulary do I have to communicate)\\n\\nPhysical closeness 'permission' and time-limit per-action/turn you cover,\\nhowever there are two things I might add that limit effectiveness of\\ncommunication:\\n* Role-playing\\n* Language limits\\n\\nWith roleplaying, while it may be optimal to take a course of action, it may\\nnot be what the character would do (for example, against a demon and a lich it\\nmay be optimal to disrupt the lich's spellcasting, but your character may have\\nhatred of demons).  This is most applicable in TTRPGs like D&D and Pathfinder\\nand less applicable in Video Games or some Board Games.   This doesn't limit\\ntheoretical communication, but may limits it's impact depending on your group.\\n\\nLanguage limits the dictionary of what can be said, but doesn't necessarily\\nlimit how much can be said within that dictionary.  For example, Gloomhaven\\nbefore your two cards are selected limits communication to 'relative' values\\n(ex. I am going as fast as possible and will do an AoE) rather than absolutes\\n(ex. I am moving with Mana Bolt at 07 initiative and will top with coldfire).\\nThis still lets people communicate freely, but can limit knowledge.  This also\\nencourages players building knowledge of each others abilities and what they do\\nin combat, somewhat like a small group of mercenaries would.\\n\\nCategories: [Gamedev]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Gamedev=true), [Mechanic Ideas]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Mechanic-Ideas=true)\"\n    :name \"limiting-collaboration.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Gamedev\"\n                  \"Mechanic Ideas\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Gamedev=true), [Mechanic Ideas]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 3582\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 420}\n   {:path \"content/docs/gamedev/mechanic-ideas/low-friction-turn-based-tactics.md\"\n    :title \"Low Friction Turn Based Tactics\"\n    :markdown \"# Minimizing UI Friction in Turn Based Tactics Games\\n\\n## One-click actions\\n\\nGames like XCOM, Fire Emblem, Warhammer 40k Mechanicus, Gloomhaven Digital etc.\\nsometimes have a problem with requiring many clicks/actions from the player to\\nexecute actions.  To minimize this, you could have the player's options for\\nwhat a character should do on a tile appear as a button on that tile. For\\nmultiple actions these buttons could be arranged in a grid.\\n\\nFor example, a character could move to an empty tile (just one option with one\\nbutton).  Or if they could cast an aoe ability on that tile then on hover that\\ntile would have two buttons.  Clicking one would automatically take that\\naction.\\n\\nWhen hovering an enemy, buttons would appear for each type of attack the\\ncharacter could do.  For out of range enemies, a shadow movement could appear\\nwhen hovering to make the attack possible with just one click!\\n\\n## Show Ability Effect On Hover\\n\\nAnother common annoyance I run into in turn based games is how many individual\\nchecks I sometimes have to do when making a decision for a character's action.\\nFor instance, if I want to find out which enemy I want to attack, I usually need\\nto go through each possible enemy in range, start the attack process, review the\\ndamage/probability/other effect preview window, then remember that information so that I\\ncan compare it to every other possible action I have.  This is sometimes really\\ntrivial (when there is a single enemy, for instance), but sometimes really involved\\nto the point where I need to start double checking the preview windows as I forget\\nwhat they contained.\\n\\nOne way to solve this is to show a small pop-up preview window on top of every\\npossible target when hovering over a skill/attack/spell. This mock-up shows a simple\\nexample of a healing spell with only the amount healed shown.  In practice, you would\\nalso want to show probability to hit, any effects the spell applies (e.g. poison), etc.\\n\\n![Hoverable outcomes](/docs/gamedev/mechanic-ideas/hoverable-outcomes-healing.png)\\n\\nThis example is overly simple and doesn't fully show the usefulness of this feature. In\\na real game, the diversity of outcomes would be much greater most of the time.\\n\\n### Enemy abilities\\n\\nOne extension of this feature is to make it so that when hovering over an enemy the same\\npop-up preview window would appear on all the squares it can target (even with moving).\\nThe window would contain that enemy's current intent given the state of the game, which\\nwould change as you moved your characters around.  This would make it easier to see what\\nenemies are capable of, and would make it less likely that the player would get blindsided\\nby something they didn't think was possible, which is a bad experience especially if it leads\\nto the player reloading the encounter.\\n\\nAdmittedly, this might be pretty hard to implement completely depending on the game's rules.\\nEven if this isn't implemented, games that are wholly lacking any way to see what enemies can\\ndo (what effects their attacks will have on your characters) besides doing all the math yourself\\nI find very tedious (see the turn-based modes for Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity 2).\\n\\nCategories: [Gamedev]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Gamedev=true), [Mechanic Ideas]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Mechanic-Ideas=true)\"\n    :name \"low-friction-turn-based-tactics.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Gamedev\"\n                  \"Mechanic Ideas\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Gamedev=true), [Mechanic Ideas]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 3322\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/gaming/buying-games.md\"\n    :title \"Buying Games\"\n    :markdown \"# Buying PC Games\\n\\n## [isthereanydeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/)\\n\\nStore aggregation site where you can search for the best game prices across\\nmany stores.

I'm writing them here so I don't forget them, and so others might learn\\nsomething - or point out flaws in my reasoning so I can get better!\\n\\n## Information, and Proactivity\\n\\nMost FPS fights come down to proactively acting on information about where\\nexactly your opponent is. If you know with precision where your opponent is,\\nand they don't know where you are, you can confidently peek at them and often\\neven prefire (or shoot as you are peeking).  Even if your aim is worse, you\\nwill most of the time win the fight because your opponent has to reactively (1)\\nnotice you, (2) readjust their aim (often >90 degrees of turning), and then (3)\\nshoot - whereas you get to skip the first two steps.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are peeking off of an information advantage, you also have\\nthe benefit of controlling the timing of the fight. Since you are peeking\\naround cover, you can always easily reverse your peek and duck back behind\\ncover if needed to reload or retreat.  This gives yet another massive advantage\\nto you.\\n\\nUsually, proactively peeking someone involves you moving, but it can sometimes\\ninvolve you staying still in an unexpected place and using audio cues to\\nanticipate an enemy coming into view.  Here, even though you are not moving,\\nyou are still the proactive party - your opponent is reacting to you.  Of\\ncourse, for this to work, you must be sure your opponent doesn't know where you\\nare, otherwise they will peek you and almost certainly win since they control\\nthe timing of the fight.\\n\\n## Getting and Keeping an Information Advantage\\n\\nTo win as many fights as possible, it's crucial to take those fights with an\\ninformation advantage. But how do you get this advantage and keep it as much as\\npossible?\\n\\n### The Cone of Danger\\n\\nThe most useful way I've found to do this is to always hold in your head a\\nmodel of where your opponents might be.  One way to think about this is a \\\"cone\\nof danger\\\".  Imagine you can see through the walls of the map you are playing\\non.  Then draw a cone from the leftmost enemy all the way to the rightmost\\nenemy.  This is the \\\"cone of danger\\\" you need to expect you opponents to be in.\\nPractically, since you normally cannot see through walls, you'll need to\\nconstantly estimate this, drawing the cone from corners enemies could peek out\\nat you from.\\n\\n![Cone Start](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_start.png)\\n\\nIdeally, you want to keep this code as small as possible:\\n\\n![Cone Small](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_small.png)\\n\\nwhile making your opponent's cone as large as possible:\\n\\n![Cone Large](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_large.png)\\n![Cone Max](/docs/games/cone_of_danger_max.png)\\n\\nThe best way to do this is by making it possible for yourself to move around\\nyour opponent freely without them seeing you, while making it so any movement\\nthey make is detectable by you. This generally involves controlling (knowing\\nfor certain no enemies are in) most of the map.\\n\\nPractically, moving around a lot also helps mess with your opponents cone. Even\\nif you have the ability to move around your opponent freely, your opponent will\\noften make the assumption you stayed still - if they are right, then they have\\na very small cone when they go to peek you. A good practice is to always move\\nafter an enemy sees you if possible.\\n\\nDifferent games provide different tools to help determine where opponents are.\\nUse these!\\n\\n### Stealth vs Spotted Mode\\n\\nOne helpful thought pattern is always knowing if you are operating in \\\"stealth\\nmode\\\" or in \\\"spotted mode\\\".\\n\\nIn \\\"stealth mode\\\", your opponents don't know where you are. When in stealth\\nmode, the goal is to get into a position where you can get some free shots in on\\nyour opponents from an angle they aren't looking at. Once you do get those shots\\nin, or are otherwise spotted, you immediately transition to \\\"spotted mode\\\".\\n\\nIn \\\"spotted mode\\\", your opponents know your position and (you should assume)\\nthey are taking steps to peek you as unpredictably as they can. Here, the\\nprimary goal is to get back to either the safety of your teammates or a hidden\\nlocation in which you can't easily be trapped (e.g. a room with many exits as\\nopposed to one or two).\\n\\nBecause the transition between stealth mode and spotted mode is so instant, it's\\nhelpful to always keep in mind an escape route when you are in stealth mode,\\njust in case you are spotted. This is for instance why a flank like this can be\\nbad:\\n\\n```\\n<T>           |        <O>\\n     <T>      |      <O>          |   <You>\\n                     <O>\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n<T> = Teammate\\n<O> = Opponent\\n<You> = You\\n| or - = cover\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, even if you get a free kill from surprise, your opponents could easily surround and 3v1 you once you are spotted.\\n\\nIt may be better to take an approach like this:\\n\\n```\\n<T>           |        <O>\\n     <T>      |      <O>\\n                     <O>\\n\\n                |\\n\\n                    -------\\n\\n                   <You>\\n```\\n\\nHere at the very least once you are spotted you have a clear, safe path back to\\nyour teammates.\\n\\nOf course, doing a 180 degree flank may be totally fine if you have some other\\nway to escape, either due to some map feature or character ability.\\n\\n## Peeking Unknown Corners\\n\\nIf you are peeking around a corner into an unknown area with many potential\\nenemy locations, it's best to jiggle peak back and forth around the corner\\nchecking each individual location one-by-one. This will help make sure you are\\nnot fighting multiple enemies at once, and will give you control over fight\\ntiming.  Be careful that this can be difficult when close to a corner, since\\nevery unit of movement you make will expose a lot more of you than if you were\\nfurther from the corner.\\n\\n## Cover\\n\\nIn games like Apex Legends, it's a good principle to keep part of your screen\\nobscured by cover when fighting, to give your opponent a smaller area to hit. At\\nthe very least, make it so that when you are peeking out of cover you are also\\nshooting - this way worst case you are trading damage one-to-one with your\\nopponent.\\n\\n## Influences\\n\\n - [Great break down by CoachNihil of kandyrew's\\n   gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4QuNEkLtl8&ab_channel=kandyrew)\\n   which helped inspire the \\\"cone of danger\\\" thinking.\\n\\nCategories: [Gaming]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Gaming=true)\"\n    :name \"fps-principles.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Gaming\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 6393\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/gaming/oxygen-not-included.md\"\n    :title \"Oxygen Not Included\"\n    :markdown \"# Oxygen Not Included\\n\\nA cool base building game with a focus on designing complex interacting\\nsystems.\\n\\n## Build Ideas\\n\\nArbor tree -> ethanol setup: \\n - https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/110495-trees-petroleum-generator/\\n - https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/111356-arbor-tree-farming/?tab=comments\\n\\nDreko farm for plastic: https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/95124-an-easy-to-build-compact-and-efficient-glossy-drecko-farm/\\n\\n\\nCategories: [Gaming]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Gaming=true)\"\n    :name \"oxygen-not-included.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Gaming\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 536\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/gaming/recommendations.md\"\n    :title \"Recommendations\"\n    :markdown \"# Recommendations\\n\\nCheck out the following filters on my \\\"experiences\\\" page for recommended games:\\n\\n - [Puzzle Games]({{< relref \\\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/experiences.md\\\" >}}?game=true&puzzle=true)\\n - [Real Time Competitive Games]({{< relref \\\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/experiences.md\\\" >}}?game=true&competitive=true)\\n\\nCategories: [Gaming]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Gaming=true)\"\n    :name \"recommendations.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Gaming\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/experiences.md\"\n            \"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/experiences.md\"\n            \"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 390\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/health-and-longevity/aging-science.md\"\n    :title \"Aging Science\"\n    :markdown \"# Aging Science\\n\\n## (My) Open Questions\\n\\nDo cell lines age?

The way it\\nworks is you take two foods that go well together (e.g. banana and peanut\\nbutter) and you add a third food that goes well with one of the foods but would\\nbe weird to combine with the other (e.g. spinach in this case).  More often\\nthan not, the result is actually pretty good!\\n\\n## Microwave Steam Bowls\\n\\nA really easy and convenient way to make some pretty tasty (and healthy!) food.\\nThe basic premise is that you add your vegetables with a splash of water to a\\nbowl, cover it with a plate, and microwave for 5-8 minutes. Then you add extra\\nflavors and enjoy! It's easy to get creative with the cooking technique, but\\nhere are some examples:\\n\\n### Carrots/Onions\\n\\nChop carrots and onions, add water and cook, finish with almond butter and\\nsalt.  Add chia seeds optionally to soak up the water!\\n\\n### Thai Carrots/Onions\\n\\nSame recipe as before, but instead of almond butter, use natural (e.g. Adams)\\npeanut butter with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and optionally lime juice.\\n\\n### Honey Walnut Shrimp Inspired\\n\\nChop cabbage, add water and cook with brown rice, finish with walnuts and\\nmayonnaise. \\n\\n## Staples\\n\\n### Flax Peanut Butter\\n\\nMixing ground flaxseed and natural peanut butter in around a 1:1 ratio makes a\\ngreat nut butter!  You'll need to add some water to make it a paste (and not\\njust powdery).  \\n\\nThis recipe has a good omega-3/6 ratio too.  Per 100g, peanut butter has 9.7g\\nomega-6 and 0.3g omega-3 fatty acids.  Per 100g, flax seeds have 5.9g omega-6\\nand 22.8g omega-3 fatty acids.  So combined, we have 23.1g omega3 and 15.6g\\nomega-6, a **~1.5 ratio**!  Data was taken from NCCDB via Cronometer.\\n\\n### Oats\\n\\n - 1 cup rolled oats\\n - 2 cups water\\n - Some salt\\n\\nBoil water, add oats, cook for 5 mins on stovetop.  Watch out for boiling over\\nin first couple minutes!  Can also microwave for 3 mins.\\n\\nTo make overnight oats, use the same ratios, but just leave the oats in the\\nfridge overnight instead of cooking. I highly recommend addng chia seeds and/or\\ncoconut and/or some other kind of nut + some fruit when making overnight oats.\\nYogurt is also good.\\n\\nSome good toppings:\\n\\n - Coffee (could even cook in coffee instead of water).\\n - Chia seeds\\n - Nutmeg\\n - Cinnamon\\n\\n### Roasted Vegetables\\n\\nAll at 425F.\\n\\nVegetable      | Size     | Time (mins)\\n---------      | -------- | -----------\\nPotato         | 1/2 in   | 40 - 50\\nZucchini       | 1/2 in   | 20\\nBroccoli       | floret   | 20\\nBrussel Sprout | halved   | 20\\nTomato (roma)  | sliced   | 15\\n\\nSee also [this\\nchart](https://www.myfrugalhome.com/vegetable-roasting-times-chart/).\\n\\nAdd thyme, rosemary, salt, garlic for extra flavor!  Add olive oil after or\\nbefore.\\n\\n### Soup\\n\\nSaute (cook) onions, carrots, and/or celery for ~5 minutes in a soup pot with\\nsome olive oil.  Add garlic and cook for ~1 more minute.\\n\\nNext, add a bunch of either stock or water with stock concentrate (e.g. \\\"Better\\nThan Bullion\\\") and add chopped ingredients to boil based on this time table:\\n\\nIngredient      | Time (mins)\\n---------       | -----------\\nBeans           | 90-120 + presoaking overnight\\nGreens          | 3-5\\nGreen beans     | 3\\nLentils         | 25\\nPotatoes        | 20\\nBarley          | 50\\nPasta           | 8-12\\nBrown Rice      | 45\\nWhite Rice      | 15\\n\\nThis table is also accurate for just boiling anything - not necessarily as a\\npart of a soup.\\n\\n\\n## Baking\\n\\n### Apple Oat Almond Cookies/Smoothie\\n\\n - 3 large apples\\n - 1 cup rolled oats\\n - 1 cup whole almonds (soaked for 1 hour)\\n\\n1.

Based on the\\ninformation in the book, it seemed like fasting provided some easily attainable\\nhealth benefits, if making it a habit wasn't too disruptive to my life.  My\\nfirst experiment happened shortly after reading the book.  I attempted a\\nDIY-Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) as described in the book for 5 days.\\n\\nI used [eatthismuch](https://www.eatthismuch.com/) to pre-plan my meals for the\\nFMD.  I think it would have been much harder for me to adhere to the diet if I\\ndid not do this.  Here is what I ate:\\n\\n![DIY-FMD-1](/docs/health-and-longevity/DIY-FMD-1.png)\\n![DIY-FMD-2](/docs/health-and-longevity/DIY-FMD-2.png)\\n\\nIf my memory serves me well, I remember feeling quite good during my fast,\\nwhich some minor headaches on day 2-3.  I did this during my vacation from\\nwork, and I don't remember working intensely on any particular project during\\nthis time, so I wouldn't consider this a \\\"stress test\\\" of the diet.\\n\\n\\n### Water Only Fast - December 2020\\n\\nFurther exposure to fasting proponents, especially Peter Attia (via e.g. [his\\npodcast with Eileen White](https://peterattiamd.com/eileenwhite/), made me\\nthink about the simpler prospect of doing a water only fast.  I finally\\nattempted this during a work week in December 2020.  My schedule looked like:\\n\\n - Tuesday:\\n   - Large Spinach, Tomato, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Italian Seasoning Salad for lunch\\n   - Some walnuts for dinner\\n - Wednesday:\\n   - Only water\\n - Thursday:\\n   - 4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate (in water) +\\n     steak seasoning\\n - Friday:\\n   - 4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate + potassium\\n     containing spice mix\\n\\nHere are the stock ingredients I used:\\n\\n![stock-front](/docs/health-and-longevity/stock-front.jpg)\\n![stock-back](/docs/health-and-longevity/stock-back.jpg)\\n\\nI felt surprisingly normal during my fast.  Especially when exercising - I went\\non my normal ~3 mile run on Thursday with 25 * 2 sets of push ups and 10 * 3\\nsets of pull ups interspersed and felt actually **better** than I normally do.\\nPerhaps this was because of the water/glycogen weight I lost at the start of\\nthe fast (~5 lbs, 190lbs -> 185lbs).\\n\\nThere were times when I felt a bit lightheaded also during the fast, but never\\ntoo seriously.  This may have been a bit psychological, since I knew I was\\nfasting.\\n\\nOne thing I also noticed was it was even harder than normal for me to keep warm\\nin my ~65F apartment, especially when sleeping.  The Wed-Thurs night I did not\\nsleep very well because of this.  Any kind of draft under the blankets was very\\nnoticeable and interrupted my sleep.  I wearing light sweatpants and a shirt\\nthe next night helped a lot (usually I sleep close to naked).  On the whole, I\\nwould say my sleep was worse during the fast than normal.\\n\\nI did notice some tingling in my arms/legs, especially when putting a acute\\nforce on them.  For instance, when doing push-ups, my hands would start\\ntingling.  And when putting my ankle on my knee when sitting, it would tingle\\nstrongly.  Apparently, [this is\\nexpected](https://www.theartofketo.com/tag/tingling-while-fasting/).  This was\\nreduced when I starting drinking broth.\\n\\nOne thing that I also definitely noticed during my fast was a shift in my\\nbrain activity.  I felt much more \\\"on\\\" than usual - I had a consistant motivation\\nto be busy in one way or another.  However, I also felt a bit more impatient.\\nIf a task I was busy doing started to stall, I would eagerly try to shift to\\nanother task, or even multitask.  This was good for getting lots done, but not\\nas helpful for cracking a difficult problem (e.g. debugging a computer program)\\nI could use this feature of fasting in the future if I need to be particularly\\nproductive in this way.\\n\\nCategories: [Health And Longevity]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Health-And-Longevity=true)\"\n    :name \"fasting.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 4585\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/health-and-longevity/finding-care.md\"\n    :title \"Finding Care\"\n    :markdown \"# Finding Care\\n\\nhttps://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals/hmi-interactive#HMI-Summary-Report-Current-Spending\\n\\nApparently, hospitals with more local competition do better (and you should go\\nto them): https://freakonomics.com/podcast/are-more-expensive-hospitals-better/\\n\\nCategories: [Health And Longevity]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Health-And-Longevity=true)\"\n    :name \"finding-care.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 367\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 420}\n   {:path \"content/docs/health-and-longevity/food.md\"\n    :title \"Food\"\n    :markdown \"# Food\\n\\n## Goals\\n\\n1. Delay chronic diseases as long as possible.  Described well in [this talk by\\n   Peter Attia](https://vimeo.com/228845024).  The\\n   [big ones](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) are:\\n   1. Cardiovascular disease.\\n   1. Cancer.\\n   1. Neurodegenerative disease.\\n   1. Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome.\\n1. Maintain sustained energy levels as much as possible, avoiding:\\n   1. Periods of low motivation.\\n   1. \\\"Food coma-ing\\\".\\n   1. \\\"Snack train-ing\\\", or continuous distraction by a desire to eat more.\\n\\n## Current Eating Habits and Opinions (3/2022)\\n\\n### Food Timing\\n\\nI try to eat a breakfast after I wake up - around 9am, since I wake up around\\n8:30am.  Then I tend not to eat lunch, and instead eat my second (and last)\\nmeal of the day at around 5 or 6pm.\\n\\nI converged on this strategy via the observation that eating food when I am not\\nhungry (too quickly after my last meal) really kills my energy levels. With\\nthis strategy, I can eat two large meals and avoid this problem, maximizing the\\namount of time I can stay capable of doing whatever I want during the day.\\n\\nWith this strategy (and any food timing strategy IMO) it's important for me to\\nsuppress suggestions from my mind to combat momentary ebbs in energy with a\\nsnack. This pretty much never works for me, always making me more tired then\\nbefore I ate the snack. Green tea is a good placeholder to have instead. Or\\neven better, an engaging activity that captures my attention.\\n\\nThis strategy also has the danger of going on a snack train when having my\\nsecond meal. If I eat too much in the evening, it leads to much poorer sleep\\nfor me (possibly because the energy in the food is released as heat and\\nexcitement when I am sleeping). I don't have a great consistent way to avoid\\nthis problem yet, besides my willpower (which is not consistent :/). Some\\ntricks that kinda work are:\\n\\n - Lining up an engaging activity to do right after I eat, so I don't just\\n   default to snacking more.\\n - Drinking tea or broth after eating as a replacement behavior.\\n\\n### [Fasting]({{< relref \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/fasting.md\\\" >}}).\\n\\nI haven't done a long fast in a while, but am experimenting with fasting one\\nday a week (Saturday) and still want to do a long fast 3x per year.  \\n\\n### Diet Composition\\n\\nI'm playing with using [this eatthismuch meal\\nplan](https://www.eatthismuch.com/dietset/196607506/) as a general description\\nof what my food intake looks like. I should probably eat less fat to adhere to\\n[Valter Longo's\\nrecommendations](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).\\n\\n#### Confidence Levels\\n\\nBecause it is hard (for me at least) to get good, immediate feedback from my\\nbody about which foods are the \\\"healthiest\\\" for me in the long term, I instead\\nhave to rely on information from other people to figure out what food I should\\neat. I'm [working to combat this]({{< relref\\n\\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/biomarker-correlator.md\\\" >}}) but realistically\\nwill need to continue to do this for a while. Unfortunately, there are many\\nopinions out there about what food is healthy, and trusting one necessarily\\nmeans discounting others, which might be right. Here I try to be honest with\\nmyself about where my personal opinions come from so that I can more\\neffectively identify and correct them.\\n\\n - \ud83d\udcfa = I've been exposed to a lot of random media supporting this opinion, but\\n   don't really understand the details.\\n - \ud83d\udcc8 = This is an interesting statistical trend, but correlation != causation.\\n - \ud83d\udca1 = This is a plausible idea, but I haven't found evidence that it has\\n   health effects in humans. In other words, it's [a nice conjecture, but\\n   requires more criticism]({{< relref\\n   \\\"/docs/understanding-the-world/influences.md#the-beginning-of-infinity-by-david-deutschhttpsenwikipediaorgwikithe_beginning_of_infinity\\\"\\n   >}}).\\n - \ud83d\udcda = This is the best explanation I know of, and has withstood a good amount\\n   of criticism, although of course it might still be wrong.\\n - \ud83e\udde0 = This is a personal observation I've made about myself.\\n\\nTODO move these emojis to a more central location so I can use them in other\\nwritings.\\n\\n#### Meat (non-fish)\\n\\nI try to avoid eating meat. There are a bunch of weak reasons for this:\\n\\n1. I perceive the supply chain that produces meat as being messy and\\n   suffering-causing \ud83d\udcfa. Another way to phrase this is: I don't think I would\\n   want to run my own personal meat-producing supply chain even if it was\\n   low-effort.\\n1. Meat consumption using our current supply chain is energy/space/time\\n   inefficient compared to other food sources \ud83d\udcda. I don't think this is a\\n   problem that we should rely on individual choices to solve (like other\\n   climate change related problems), so it's a pretty weak reason for an\\n   individual to not eat meat IMO. Larger systemic changes like taxes on meat\\n   seem to me like the more effective way to take action on this information.\\n1. Meat consumption seems be to [weakly associated with\\n   cancer](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat)\\n   \ud83d\udcc8 and other common causes of death. This may be because of the proteins in\\n   meat causing up-regulation of growth factors like IGF-1, which may\\n   accelerate aging \ud83d\udca1.\\n1. The \\\"blue zone\\\" communities around the world with high health- and\\n   life-spans [eat little\\n   meat](https://www.bluezones.com/recipes/food-guidelines/) \ud83d\udcc8.\\n\\n#### Protein\\n\\nIt seems like [low protein consumption (especially animal protein) might slow\\naging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807119/). See [this\\ncomprehensive macronutrient mouse\\nstudy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087279/). See also this\\nreview: [The impact of dietary protein intake on longevity and metabolic\\nhealth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562018/).\\n\\nNote that it seems like this is NOT true for people over the age of 65. At this\\npoint, loss of muscle becomes a dangerous problems (leading to falls, etc.), so\\nthe benefits of eating more protein to maintain muscle mass seem to outweigh\\nthe downsides.\\n\\n#### Fish\\n\\nI eat fish and other seafood, but rarely (I don't cook it myself).\\n\\n#### Eggs\\n\\nI eat ~4 eggs a day ~4 times per week.\\n\\n#### Dairy\\n\\nI eat a small amount of yogurt and cheese. I try to avoid all other dairy\\nproducts as best I can. My throat is irritated when I drink plain milk and\\nexcessive consumption of any dairy product upsets my digestion, so I think I am\\nsomewhat personally intolerant of at least dairy from cows \ud83e\udde0.\\n\\n#### Whole Foods\\n\\nThis includes any food that has not had components stripped from it at a small\\nscale. For instance, I would consider a berry a whole food even though it was\\nseparated from the plant at the macro scale. But jam would not be a whole food\\nbecause it involves removing some fiber and other unknown stuff from the berry\\nand adding parts of other plants (sugars) that were themselves removed from\\ntheir whole plant part.\\n\\nI like the story I've heard about whole foods \ud83d\udcfa. At the very least, it seems\\nlike we evolved to eat whole foods, so the floor for how bad they can be for us\\nis fairly high and well known. Note that this theory does **not** say\\n**anything** suggesting that whole food are the best diet, just that they\\naren't that bad.\\n\\nIt also seems well supported and not controversial that eating whole foods\\nhelps delay the onset of the most common causes of death (cardiovascular\\ndisease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease) \ud83d\udcda. \\n\\n#### Organic?\\n\\nI haven't found strong evidence that organic food is healthier than non\\norganic. But it could be that the right studies just haven't been done yet or I\\nhaven't seen them. Here is an interesting review:\\n\\n - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658984/\\n\\nI buy mostly non organic food because it is cheaper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## What should I eat and when? (2021)\\n\\nThe most convincing diet structure I've found has been [The Longevity Diet by\\nValter Longo](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).\\nThis diet is mostly vegan, with fish 2-3 times per week, keeping [protein intake\\nlow](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988204/).  [This\\npodcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL21hcmtiZWxsc3Bvd2VycHJvamVjdC5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw/episode/MWZmYTNmZDQtNzFjYS00ZjFhLTg4M2YtMjJlZjNhNWFkZjRj?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwj-nLjVwKfwAhVzCjQIHY2XA70QjrkEegQICBAF&ep=6) has\\na compelling dissent of Longo's thoughts here; basically it states that Longo's\\nideas makes sense, but so do many other ideas and we know now that insufficient\\nprotein can be unhealthy (I need to dig more into this) - the evidence to lower\\nintake in spite of this is not strong enough yet.  Note that personalizing\\nprotein intake levels while optimizing longevity seems to be possible by\\n[measuring Blood Urea Nitrogen levels as described by Michael\\nLustgarten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u654YTubFRM).\\n\\nCool paper about food group epidemiology:\\nhttps://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/6/1462/4569801.\\n\\nThere are a couple of amendments I've made based on my personal experience (in\\nservice of goal 2 above).  These include:\\n\\n 1. Not eating breakfast.  I find myself most productive in a fasted state\\n    (even a [prolonged fast](/docs/eating/fasting.md), and eating breakfast breaks be\\n    right out of this in what otherwise would be a very productive time.  \\n      - This is counter to Longo's suggestions, some other research on\\n        circadian rhythms by [Sachin\\n        Panda](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730419892105), and the [American\\n        Heart\\n        Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476).\\n        The arguments here often revolve around weight loss (which I don't have\\n        a problem with yet), and don't seem too strong to me.\\n      - This does help keep a shorter eating window on my day which\\n        is widely recommended:\\n          - [Sachin Panda](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.11.004)\\n 1. Trying to eat grains and/or starchy foods later in the day.  These foods\\n    uniquely mess with my energy levels.  I'm eager to get some Continuous\\n    Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to see if I can quantitate this.  \\n\\nSome interesting thoughts on meal timing for energy levels can be found at\\nhttps://www.workingagainstgravity.com/guides/nutrition-guide/meal-timing.\\n\\nOther tenants I try to live by:\\n\\n1. Eating whole foods as much as possible.\\n\\n### My 2021 Food Strategy\\n\\n#### Things I try to avoid\\n\\n - Dairy\\n - Meat\\n - Refined carbs (e.g. flour containing foods)\\n    - [Danger of Fast Carbs](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/carbs-are-killing-us/609040/)\\n - Sugars/Syrups\\n\\n\\nIn practice I may have small amounts (<1 \\\"serving\\\") of these things about once\\na week.\\n\\nNote also that avoiding animals products is partially for health reasons\\n(avoiding cancer primarily), but also partially because the animal food\\nindustry is not easy for me to support.\\n\\n\\n#### Things I try to moderate\\n\\n - Eating more than 1/2 cup of (dry volume) beans or grains at once. A large amount of\\n   my calories come from these foods - I've just noticed that eating a lot in one\\n   sitting saps my energy, I assume because they take work to digest.\\n\\n### One Meal A Day (OMAD)\\n\\nI tried this for a while, and I found myself falling into the recurring pattern\\nof overeating because \\\"this is all the food I'll eat today\\\". This is especially\\nbad with lots of low-calorie-density, high-fiber foods (which I want to eat no\\nmatter what). The overeating would make me feel unfocused and uncomfortable for\\n4+ hours, which is not worth it for me.\\n\\nRecently, I've found that a better thought pattern for me is to say \\\"I'll eat\\nthat later\\\" when I get a craving for something right after a meal. This avoids\\na state of overeating, and I may later end up not craving that thing, which\\nmeans I'll eat less overall that day (which is generally good).\\n\\n## Hunger, and Physical States of Being\\n\\nOne thing I've noticed is that my body can be in different \\\"states\\\" that affect\\nmy hunger levels. Some examples:\\n\\n**Induces Hunger**:\\n\\n - Sitting around for a while (not moving).\\n - Being bored, or not knowing what to do with myself.\\n - Eating some food (e.g. a snack sized meal). The effect is more powerful when\\n   I eat something, then am presented with something of a different flavor\\n   profile.\\n - Overeating will sometimes make me hungry/snack-y for the rest of the day (or\\n   an extended period of time). I think this is partially because feeling\\n   overfull makes me less motivated to do stuff, and so I get bored.\\n - Working on something that isn't going well. Generally stress. Food is a good\\n   procrastination tool.\\n\\n**Suppresses Hunger**:\\n\\n - Exercising\\n - Being busy\\n - Social interaction\\n - Taking a shower\\n\\nOne theory I have is that my body gets hungry when it notices that (1) there is\\nfood around and (2) I have time/space to digest after I eat (I wont need to\\nimmediately do something that requires lots of energy).\\n\\nSome habits that take advantage of this concept include:\\n\\n - Distracting myself with busywork when I feed hungry but don't (consciously)\\n   want to eat.\\n - Eating one meal a day, so that I don't have a \\\"snack-train\\\" problem of\\n   having future meals induce hunger.\\n\\n### \\\"Snack Train\\\"-ing\\n\\nOne pattern I've noticed in myself that eating food will put me in a\\nlower-focus mood for 1-4 hours depending on how much and what I ate. If I try\\nto do something that requires focus in this mood, my body will resist me and\\noften want to eat more food instead as an alternative activity. Unfortunately,\\neating more food will just perpetuate the cycle; in fact it will become even\\nharder to focus as more of my energy needs to go to digestion.\\n\\nThe key here is to break the cycle by somehow riding through the low energy\\nmood without pushing myself so much that I want to eat. Sometimes this is\\nreally hard, because doing things that require focus is fulfilling :(. \\n\\nI'm basically just writing this as a reminder to myself to push through when\\nI'm in this mood for the sake of my future self!\\n\\n\\n## Measuring Personal Dietary Effects\\n\\nIdeally, I would measure the effects of different foods on my personal health\\ndirectly so that I know what works for me (as opposed to what should work\\ngenerally).

The biggest takeaway I got from it is that our\\ntendency to break down foods and biology in general into atomic\\nnutrients/aspects and pretend that is all they are (for easier study) leads\\noften to bad models of reality.  Biological systems are highly interwoven and\\nthe impact of stuff on them often depends on the greater context.

One of the\\ncore thesis is that our western diet has a higher-than-historical ratio of\\nomega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, which causes problems.  This is because the\\nbody can use these fats for the same purposes, but they have different\\nperformances for those purposes.  For example,\\n[prostaglandins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin) can be made with\\nomega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, but the omega-3 variants are less \\\"strong\\\" and\\nmay contribute less to heart disease.\\n\\nDoes a really excellent job of telling the story of the scientists who\\nstudy/studied these fats, instead of just passing down diet rules without\\ncontext.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_ratio_in_food has some data about\\nomega-3/omega-6 ratios.\\n\\n## [How Not to Die by Michael Gregor](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/)\\n\\nThis book is a good survey of diet from the \\\"Whole Food Plant Based\\\"\\nperspective.  Sometimes I think the author gets a bit over-zealous about how\\nhis philosophy is the best and makes lazy, broad, strong statements that are\\nnot adequately supported.  For instance, dismissing certain foods (like meat)\\nas obviously unhealthy without examining the counterpoints.\\n\\nThe author's web site [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) is a\\ndecent source of information, though it suffers from the same problems as the\\nbook.\\n\\n## [Genius Foods by Max Lugavere](https://www.maxlugavere.com/book)\\n\\nThis book takes a more brain focused approach to diet, which pushes it more\\ninto the keto- space.  AFAIK, ketogenic diets are more linked to brain health\\nthan other diets.  I think it falls into the same trap as Michael Gregor, but\\nnot quite as badly.  It's a good intro to lots of cool food/health topics to\\nexplore more independently.  \\n\\n## [Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)\\n\\nThis book provides some insight into the mechanisms of sleep, and advocates\\nthat people should generally spend more time sleeping (or give sleep more value\\nthat they currently do).

Then the app uses your movements to wake you up during a\\nlighter sleep phase.  I've found this to be **way** more pleasant than waking\\nup at a fixed time.  In fact, I've found that I more naturally wake up by\\nmyself in the morning right before the alarm goes off, as if my body\\nassociates it with lighter sleep.\\n\\nThis app also tracks my sleep, which is kinda useful sometimes.\\n\\n## Causes of Bad Sleep\\n\\n### Racing Mind\\n\\nAnything that causes me to be constantly thinking about something will usually\\ninterrupt my sleep.  This includes:\\n\\n - Trying to make sure I remember something that I need to do tomorrow.  See\\n   [Task Tracking]({{< relref \\\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/task-tracking.md\\\">}})\\n   for an excellent solution to this problem.\\n - Worrying about an event or something that I need to wake up for (like a\\n   flight).\\n - Worrying about a personal conflict or argument, or any kind of unresolved\\n   tension between me and someone else. \\n - Trying to sleep right after doing an activity I was really engaged in, like\\n   playing a game. This will happen if my mind is continuing to ponder the\\n   decisions I was making in the activity, or if it's re-remembering parts of\\n   the activity (and e.g. how I could have done them better).\\n\\n### Food\\n\\nEating more that ~1/3 of my daily calories, especially from fatty foods, in the\\n5-6 hours before sleeping will often lead to me getting overheated and sweaty\\nafter being asleep for a couple hours. This is especially true if it's\\notherwise cold in the room where I'm sleeping and I need to tuck myself in more\\ntightly to my blankets.\\n\\nEating a big (fatty) breakfast and either an early dinner (like 4pm) or no\\ndinner helps with this.\\n\\nCaffeine definitely does not help me sleep :).\\n\\n### Temperature and Airflow\\n\\n#### Skin Stimulation\\n\\nFor me I find that keeping my skin calm makes a big difference to my\\nsleep quality.  For me, this means keeping myself a proper temperature and\\nkeeping myself protected from breezes and other forces that can tickle or\\notherwise stimulate my skin.\\n\\nIn practice, I best accomplish this by:\\n\\n1. Wearing socks or lower-leg warmers to sleep so that my feet don't get\\n   uncomfortably cold.\\n1. Wearing boxers.\\n1. Wrapping myself with flannel or otherwise \\\"warm-feeling\\\" sheets to that my\\n   skin is constantly in contact with something constant and not exposed to\\n   fluctuations in air temperature or movement.\\n\\n#### Cold\\n\\nOne common pattern I fall into that leads to poor sleep is being too cold when\\ngoing to sleep. This leads me to tightly hug my arms close to my self and tuck\\nmy sheets up to my neck (holding onto them with my hands). While this is\\ncomfortable when going to sleep, I find that it leads me to overheat once I\\nactually do fall asleep. This leads to me getting sweaty, and then cold and\\nuncomfortable.  I feel a similar effect when using sleeping bags or wearing\\na shirt when going to bed.\\n\\nDue to this pattern, I find that it's paradoxically better for me to use more\\nblankets and/or a heated mattress pad and fall asleep in a more relaxed posture\\nwith looser sheets/more airflow. This is less likely to cause the overheating ->\\nsweaty -> cold/uncomfortable issue.\\n\\nIn addition to making me bundle myself too tightly when going to sleep, being\\ncold also just generally stimulates my mind/body, which hinders my ability to\\nfall asleep.\\n\\nI've found a good way to manage cold is to use a heated mattress pad or heated\\nblanket to pre-warm my bed, which helps me feel relaxed and warm as I get into\\nbed.  Then, right before going to sleep, I turn off the heat and make sure I\\nhave enough warm blankets around in case I do end up cooling down. \\n\\n#### Showering\\n\\nTaking a shower generally gives me temperature sensitive skin that makes it\\nhard to find a good equilibrium when falling asleep, making it more likely that\\nI'll get too cold or overheat later in the night.\\n\\nGoing to sleep with wet hair from a shower also can exacerbate temperature\\nissues. At the very least it make my pillow wet, which is annoying.\\n\\nI find that showering ~2 hours before sleeping makes these non-issues.\\n\\n\\n## Sleep Resources\\n\\n - Interesting take on the effects sleep has on your physiology:\\n   https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/\\n\\nCategories: [Health And Longevity]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Health-And-Longevity=true)\"\n    :name \"sleep.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Health And Longevity\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/task-tracking.md\"\n            \"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 4554\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/health-and-longevity/theories-of-aging.md\"\n    :title \"Theories Of Aging\"\n    :markdown \"# Theories of Aging\\n\\n## Information Theory of Aging\\n\\nOver time, small defects in our epigenome build up as proteins constantly fix\\nDNA damage.

Unfortunately, there is a great deal of\\nvariation between different people in what is physically healthy for them, and\\nboth studies and anecdotes can be systematically flawed.\\n\\nProbably the most reliable way to stay vigorous and healthy for the longest\\npossible time is by self-experimenting to see what behaviors work best for you.\\nOf course, using anecdotes/epidemiology/randomized controlled trials to inform\\nwhat to try will greatly accelerate your ability to settle on the best habits.\\n\\n## Inputs\\n\\nThese are things you can change or habits you can adapt to effect your health.\\nTracking them is useful to correlate them with outputs.\\n\\n### Food\\n\\n#### Methods\\n\\n - Weighing food, logging with [cronometer](https://cronometer.com/).\\n   - Upsides: You get lots of data about even very specific micronutrients,\\n     helping spot difficiencies.\\n   - Downsides: Difficult but doable, especially with food you don't prepare yourself.\\n   - Tip: If using the free version https://pi-hole.net/ will help make the ad\\n     experience less painful.\\n - Taking pictures of food, using [bitesnap](https://getbitesnap.com/)\\n   - Upsides: Easy to do\\n   - Downsides: Not super accurate for quantities\\n - Taking pictures of food, using [Momentodb](https://mementodatabase.com/)\\n   - Upsides: Very easy to do\\n   - Downsides: No data, have to manually refer back to each image.\\n\\nTracking food quantity without a scale is pretty tricky.

To me, a list\\nprice is just a large number that has little or any meaning to the impact\\nbuying that house will have on my finances.  To confidently judge whether a\\nhouse I'm interested in buying is actually a good deal, I made the spreadsheet\\ndescribed here. **The primary goal of the spreadsheet is to translate details\\nabout the house (e.g. it's price) into an expected percentage return that can\\nbe directly compared to other investments.**\\n\\nHere is the spreadsheet:\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11GTEiYBGF1NXaob9DczvUcQyloDVQ-dJfALDsg-L4-U/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\nOn the left side of the spreadsheet are a bunch of blue fields where details\\nabout the house should be filled in.

Some useful estimates can be found on Redfin ([rawer\\n   data](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/),\\n   [summarized](https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market)), but you can't\\n   always use the past to predict the future! I just set a really conservative\\n   value here and pray.\\n - **Property Land Value**: <br/> The value of the land the property sits on.\\n   This is used to calculate depreciation (since land doesn't depreciate, only\\n   man made structures do). In you live in the Seattle area, you can find this\\n   information by searching for the property on\\n   https://gismaps.kingcounty.gov/parcelviewer2/.\\n - **Property Tax Rate**: <br/> Can also be found on a local parcel viewer\\n   resource, or even on listings.  Taxes collected on properties are public\\n   record in the US. Using prior year taxes is usually a good way to estimate\\n   this; I found that the tax appraisals for properties can value them very\\n   differently than the market does, so multiplying the list price by the tax\\n   rate to calculate this is not recommended.\\n - **Depreciation Period**: <br/> The time after which you can assume (for tax\\n   purposes) that your property will completely turn to worthless dust. This\\n   only applies if you are using part of your property for business purposes\\n   (renting it).\\n - **Income Tax Rate**: <br/> The rate at which any rental income will be\\n   taxed.  Note that I am assuming your income tax rate doesn't change over the\\n   course of owning the property. Since income taxes on rent are essentially\\n   deferred due to depreciation and then depreciation recapture on sale, your\\n   return will be better if your income tax rate is lower when you sell the\\n   property.\\n - **Depreciation Recapture Tax Rate**: <br/> The rate at which depreciation\\n   recapture income will be taxed.  This is your ordinary income tax rate when\\n   you sell the property [OR\\n   25%](https://www.millionacres.com/taxes/depreciation/understanding-depreciation-recapture-when-you-sell-rental-property/#:~:text=That's%20what%20depreciation%20recapture%20does,4797%2C%20Sales%20of%20Business%20Property.),\\n   whichever is larger.\\n\\n\\n### Debt\\n\\n - **Down Payment**: <br/> How much upfront you will be paying for the house\\n   (in your own cash).\\n - **Years**: <br/> The time after which your mortgage will be fully paid.\\n - **Interest Rate**: <br/> Multiplying this percent by the remaining loan\\n   balance after a given year tells you how much you have to pay your lender\\n   for the privilege of using their money.\\n\\n\\n### Goals\\n\\n - **Investment Growth Rate**: <br/> How much you expect your other investments\\n   to grow by yearly on average.  This just color-codes the results (green is\\n   better than your other investments, red is worse).\\n - **Investment Tolerance**: <br/> Results minus this amount from your\\n   investment growth rate will be colored yellow.\\n - **Personal monthly \\\"rent\\\"**: <br/> This quantifies the amount of value you\\n   personally extract from the home by living in it. This makes comparisons\\n   between investments more fair, because you can't live in a stock! A good\\n   ballpark for this number is your current rent, or a rent that you would be\\n   comfortable paying.\\n - **Max Upfront Costs**: <br/> The total maximum amount of money upfront you\\n   can spend on the house. Used for color coding.\\n - **Max Monthly Costs**: <br/> The maximum amount of money you can spend on\\n   the house per month **on average**. You should always have some buffer,\\n   since many housing expenses come in large lump payments.  Used for color\\n   coding.\\n - **Portfolio Start Size**: <br/> The amount of money you have in your\\n   investment portfolio when you buy the home. Used to calculate how much of\\n   your investment portfolio is made up of by the house\\n - **Yearly Investment**: <br/> The amount of money you are investing per year\\n   into your portfolio.  Used to calculate how much of your investment\\n   portfolio is made up of by the house\\n\\n\\n### Income\\n\\n - **Rent**: <br/> The amount of rent you expect to earn from tenants living on\\n   your property.\\n - **Percentage Rented**: <br/> The percentage of your house that is considered\\n   rented. I think you can calculate this using square footage. This determines\\n   how much of all your expenses you can use to cancel out income taxes as a\\n   business expense.\\n - **Occupancy Rate**: <br/> What percent of the time you expect to have rent\\n   flowing in.\\n - **Rental Growth Rate**: <br/> How much you expect rents to increase by in a\\n   year.\\n\\n\\n### Monthly Expenses\\n\\nVarious expenses that need to be paid every month by you on behalf of the whole\\nhouse. Notice the tax deduction rate assumes that these services will be used\\nevenly by you and your tenants.\\n\\n### Selling Costs\\n\\n - **Capital Gains Rate**: <br/> The percentage of {the price you are selling\\n   the property at minus the amount you bought it for} that you must pay as\\n   tax.  Up to 250k for single owner or 500k for a joint ownership of capital\\n   gains can be ignored for a single family home.  In a duplex, this can be\\n   applied to <Percentage Rented>% of the property, the rest is subject to tax\\n   (unless you do a 1031 exchange).  See\\n   https://finance.zacks.com/rental-income-taxed-duplex-7533.html.  Note also\\n   that if you are using depreciation to offset your income tax while you own\\n   the property, this **lowers your cost basis** in the house, which increases\\n   your capital gains tax.  Additionally, this \\\"depreciation recapture\\\" tax is\\n   taxed at normal income tax rate, since that is what it offset earlier.\\n - **Closing Costs**: <br/> The percentage of the selling price you have to pay\\n   to agents that help you sell the house.

The\\n\\\"Quantified Self\\\" concept is closely related to this, although I see it as\\nbeing more specific about what it is focusing on (namely numerical\\nmeasurements).\\n\\n## Why?\\n\\nThere are two primary reasons why lifelogging interests me:\\n\\n1. Lifelogging promises to provide a perfect record that I could refer back to\\n   when trying to remember something. Some examples of things that would be\\n   nice to remember more accurately:\\n   - The ideas in an engaging conversation\\n   - The places I was in the last day where I should look for my missing keys\\n   - The stuff I did during the last week when trying to figure out what\\n     projects to continue working on.\\n   - The stuff I did over the last weekend when someone asks \\\"how was your\\n     weekend?\\\".\\n1. Finding correlations in, or otherwise analyzing, lifelogging data could lead\\nto clear insights about which behaviors lead to better health, more desirable\\nstates of mind, and better life outcomes however you want to define them.\\n   - See my [Tracking Health]({{< relref \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/tracking-health.md\\\" >}})\\n   page for more details.\\n\\n## An Ideal System\\n\\nThe primary issue with lifelogging is that collecting even small amounts of\\ninformation consistently can be very time consuming. This is exacerbated if you\\nare not running a specific experiment on yourself that requires very targeted\\ncollection, but are rather trying to paint a picture of your life that could be\\nused for more generic analysis and memory-aiding.\\n\\nTherefore, my ideal lifelogging system would be totally automatic. This could\\nbe achieved with the following components:\\n\\n - A GPS monitor logging my location.\\n   - Done using [GPSLogger](https://gpslogger.app/)\\n - Tracking food consumption via photos.\\n   - Done using [autojournal](https://github.com/kovasap/autojournal) + Google\\n     Photos.\\n   - Plan to move to [MomentoDB](https://mementodatabase.com/) for this.\\n - A wearable camera that sees what I see and stores the video somewhere.\\n   - Partially done using a [snapcam]({{< relref \\\"/docs/lifelogging/camera.md\\\"\\n     >}})\\n - A wearable microphone that hears what I hear, and transcribes all heard\\n   speech to a searchable text log, like a script to the play that is my life.\\n   - Not done yet\\n - Programs that log what I'm doing on my various devices (laptop, phone,\\n   etc.).\\n   - Almost done with [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/).\\n   - Previously/currently done with\\n     [selfspy](https://github.com/selfspy/selfspy).\\n - Tracking Exercise\\n   - Should be inferrable from my location tracking, but I haven't written the\\n     logic yet.\\n - Tracking habit adherence. Like exercise or practicing a skill.\\n   - I found [proactively assigning myself to do a habit at a specific time]({{<\\n     relref \\\"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/task-tracking.md\\\" >}})\\n     works very well, and this has the added benefit of tracking when I tick\\n     off my assignment as \\\"done\\\". I use Google Tasks for this, which show up on\\n     my Google Calendar. Ideally I would write code to save my task data so\\n     that it could be visualized in other places (and so deleted tasks wouldn't\\n     disappear from history).\\n - Various sensors that track mood and health metrics.\\n   - Manually done with [MomentoDB](https://mementodatabase.com/), therefore\\n     not consistent :/\\n   - Previously done with [Nomie](https://nomie.app/), which IMO is strictly\\n     worse than MomentoDB.\\n - Logic that tries to infer meaningful \\\"events\\\" from the datastreams collected\\n   by these components. For example, image processing software analyzing my\\n   camera feed coupled with GPS data could infer that I was playing soccer from\\n   1-2pm on Saturday.\\n   - Not done yet\\n - A place to store all the collected data.\\n   - Done with [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)\\n - A calendar or timeline -like visualization system that provides a\\n   scrollable, searchable way to browse all the generated life events.\\n   - Partially done with [autojournal](https://github.com/kovasap/autojournal).\\n   - See [continuous glucose monitoring experiment]({{< relref\\n     \\\"/docs/health-and-longevity/continuous-glucose-monitoring.md\\\" >}}) for a\\n     timeline view.\\n - A tool that can find correlations in the stored data and in general condense\\n   it down to insights.

Moving your body is good for you, especially when regularly\\n   done. If you have to go to work every day, it makes sense to couple that\\n   mandatory travel with exercise to make the exercise \\\"mandatory\\\" itself!\\n1. **Inexpensive**. Especially if you buy cheap bikes, bike commuting might be\\n   the least expensive way to travel around a city short of walking.\\n1. **On your own terms**. For me, it's important to be on my own schedule and\\n   not have to worry about public transportation schedules and parking time\\n   limits. Biking is not the only way to accomplish this, but it does a good\\n   job at it.\\n\\n## Downsides\\n\\n1. Requires living in an area where everyday needs (work, grocery, etc.) are\\n   close by. Living in these areas is usually more expensive. This is not\\n   really a con if you want to live in these areas for other reasons.\\n1. If you do not have a car, then it can be logistically harder to participate\\n   in certain activities, which will probably end up with you simply not doing\\n   them consistently.\\n\\n## Listening while Biking\\n\\nI highly recommend listening to audiobooks or podcasts when biking to both be\\nentertained and maybe learn some stuff or get inspired while you're at it.\\n\\nI used to do this by putting some large studio-style over-ear headphones over\\nmy *helmet* so that the speakers would not sit on my ears, but rather a couple\\ninches away from them. This worked pretty well, although it did look kinda\\nsilly.\\n\\nSince then I've switch to using \\\"bone-conduction\\\" headphones like\\n[these](https://amzn.to/3j79zfw) (I can't find my originally purchased ones).\\nIn my experience, these just act like tiny speakers that are close to your\\nears, but not in them - I don't get much \\\"bone-conduction\\\" effect from my pair.\\n\\nHowever you listen when biking, I highly recommend making sure you can still\\nhear what's going on around you for safety.\\n\\n## Buying a Bike\\n\\nI personally recommend buying a cheap, used bike for commuting. There are\\nseveral reasons for this:\\n\\n - Maintaining an expensive bike's high performance can itself be expensive and\\n   time consuming, especially if you ride it a lot, which you would be doing if\\n   you are commuting. A cheaper bike with worse performance will require less\\n   maintenance to keep it at its current performance level, and you can even\\n   just let it fall into disrepair and get another cheap bike when it becomes\\n   unusable. This makes the assumption that performance for commuting is not\\n   that important (it isn't for me).\\n - It's easier to buy multiple bikes if they are cheap, which has several\\n   benefits:\\n    - You can try out different styles of bike and/or bikes with different\\n      features over a longer time window.\\n    - If one bike has a problem that might take a couple days to resolve (e.g.\\n      if you are waiting for a part delivery), you still have a bike to use.\\n - Bike theft is a real problem, and having a used bike (1) makes your bike a\\n   less attractive target for thieves and (2) makes any theft that does occur\\n   less painful. AFAIK no lock perfectly secures your bike, and few/no locks\\n   secure individual bike components.\\n\\nIn a big city like Seattle, there are a lot of people selling bikes, so they\\nare usually pretty easy to find. I use [craigslist](https://craigslist.org/)\\nand [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) for this.\\n\\n## Modifications\\n\\n### Milk Crate\\n\\nThe best way I've found to transport stuff on a bike is a back rack + milk\\ncrate combo:\\n\\n![Milk Crate](/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/bike_milk_crate.jpg)\\n\\nThis securely holds things that are just placed in it (like a backpack).\\nPreviously I used straps to secure bags to the bike rack itself, but this is\\nmuch easier.  This is also **much** more pleasant than actually wearing a\\nbackpack when biking, especially if you don't want to sweat too much.\\n\\n## Rainy Weather\\n\\nOne of the worst parts of bike commuting is getting wet on the way in to work\\nand not being able to dry off.  For me, most of my cloths dry pretty quickly in\\nthe generally light Seattle rain, but my shoes and socks do not. This is\\npartially because of their relative thickness and also because they are usually\\nexposed to the most water. Even when it is not actively raining, biking on wet\\nground can toss up a good amount of water on- or into my shoes.\\n\\nI've found the best solution to this problem by far is wearing some kind of\\nwaterproof shoe covers like [these](https://amzn.to/3NvMFMK).\\n\\n## Maintenance\\n\\nMost bike maintenance is not that hard to learn, and you will save lots of time\\nand money in the long run if you learn some basics. Here I list the most common\\nproblems that can be easily addressed DIY. Check out YouTube for good tutorials\\nif I haven't linked any myself. \\n\\nMost repairs require some specialized tools, which are pretty cheap on Amazon\\n(usually less expensive than having the repair done professionally once).\\n\\n### Flat Tires\\n\\nI like to keep a couple tubes (like [this one](https://amzn.to/3qN1r87)) around\\nfor an easy change. I also use patch kits for small punctures.\\n\\nYou'll also need [tire levers](https://amzn.to/3JyEIDg) to remove your tire.\\n\\nWhen changing a tube, keep in mind that your tube was damaged by something.\\nThis could be:\\n\\n - Something that punctured your tire. Run your hands along the inside of your\\n   tire near the puncture to make sure that nothing sharp is still embedded in\\n   your tire!\\n - Your tire itself has a hole in it.\\n - Your tube folded as it inflated, or was otherwise pinched.\\n\\nYou don't want to change your tube only to have your new tube break for the\\nsame reason!\\n\\n### Skipping Gears\\n\\nSometimes when you bike you may notice skipping when pedaling, especially when\\npedaling hard. This is usually quite jarring and in bad cases can make your\\nbike fairly unridable. This issue can be caused by several different problems:\\n\\n#### 1. Misaligned Shifters\\n\\nYour gear shifters may put the chain in between two of the cogs that it wraps\\naround. To fix this, usually shifters can be shifted around by tighting or\\nloosening a screw on them.\\n\\n#### 2. A Stretched Chain\\n\\nOver time, bike chains stretch.  An overly stretched chain can lead to\\nskipping, as the distance between the links no longer properly matches the\\ndistances between the teeth on the cog. See\\nhttps://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/when-to-replace-a-chain-on-a-bicycle\\nfor a good overview of this problem.\\n\\n#### 3. Worn Cogs\\n\\nJust like chains can wear out, so can the cogs they wrap around.  This happens\\nmore slowly, and I've heard can be slowed even further by regularly replacing\\nyour chain (presumably stretched chains wear out cogs faster). When a cog is\\nworn, skipping occurs for the same reason as when a chain is worn - there is a\\nmisfit between the chain and the cog. Cogs can also break teeth, making this\\neven worse! \\n\\nNote when replacing cogs that there are two types, freewheels and cassettes.\\nIt is crucial to know which one you have before attempting a replacement! Check\\nout these sites for more details:\\n\\n - https://www.sheldonbrown.com/free-k7.html\\n - https://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/determining-cassette-freewheel-type\\n\\nI've made the mistake before of trying to replace the wrong type of cog, and\\nit's not fun.\\n\\n*Note that any links to products on this page are Amazon affiliate links.*\\n\\nCategories: [Lifestyle Optimizations]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Lifestyle-Optimizations=true)\"\n    :name \"bike-commuting.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Lifestyle Optimizations\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 7439\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/experiences.md\"\n    :title \"Experiences\"\n    :markdown \"# My Experiences\\n\\nA summary of experiences I've had, and the states of mind they invoke for me.\\nSee [Mind Mapping Concept]({{< relref\\n\\\"/docs/thought-experiments/mind-mapping-concept.md\\\" >}}) for ideas on how else\\nto display this.\\n\\n{{< experience_aggregator >}}\\n{{% include \\\"docs/lifestyle-optimizations/experiences.edn\\\" %}}\\n{{< /experience_aggregator >}}\\n\\nCategories: [Lifestyle Optimizations]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Lifestyle-Optimizations=true)\"\n    :name \"experiences.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Lifestyle Optimizations\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/thought-experiments/mind-mapping-concept.md\"\n            \"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 453\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/geographical-maps.md\"\n    :title \"Geographical Maps\"\n    :markdown \"# Geographical Maps\\n\\n - Map of what you can visually see from any given point on Earth:\\n   https://www.heywhatsthat.com/\\n\\nCategories: [Lifestyle Optimizations]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Lifestyle-Optimizations=true)\"\n    :name \"geographical-maps.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Lifestyle Optimizations\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 219\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/hang-drying-clothes.md\"\n    :title \"Hang Drying Clothes\"\n    :markdown \"# Hang (Air) Drying Cloths\\n\\nI've found that hang drying cloths over using a cloths dryer has some pretty\\nneat advantages:\\n\\n### Less Work\\n\\nIF you hang dry your cloths in a place where they can stay indefinitely, then\\nhang drying leads to this laundry workflow:\\n\\n1.

This makes it quite jarring to switch between the two, which I\\noften do when I'm writing or coding while looking at a reference document in my\\nweb browser.  \\n\\nTo fix this issue, I've tried a couple things:\\n\\n- Using a page dimmer in my web browser.\\n  - This is generally a good solution, but (since these usually inject dimming\\n    javascript or css into the page that is being viewed) does not work when\\n    viewing web browser settings or reading pdfs or using any UI that is not\\n    strictly on the page.\\n- Boosting the brightness of my terminal and dimming everything globally.\\n  - Works for all light colored programs!\\n  - The best way I could find to do this was to take the colors in the terminal\\n    colorscheme (as hex strings) and increase their brightness value to make new\\n    hex string colors, which I used as my colorscheme.  This definitly makes the\\n    terminal brighter but, as the brightness goes up, colors start maxing out\\n    util they all become white (#ffffff).  I wasn't able to boost brightness\\n    enough with this trick while keeping my colors distinct.\\n\\nThe current solution I have is to selectively apply color filters to different\\nprograms using [Compton](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compton).  This is\\nnot a feature that Compton supports natively, so I had to apply a patch I found\\n[here](https://github.com/chjj/compton/issues/266).  The patched code can be\\nfound [here](https://github.com/kovasap/compton).  To configure this method, you\\ncan add shaders (functions that change pixel colors) to the\\n`compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl` file in the root of that\\nrepository.  I run it by adding this to my `~/.xinitrc`:\\n\\n```\\n~/.xinitrc\\n---\\ncompton --glx-prog-win-rule ~/compton/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl:'class_g=\\\"Google-chrome\\\"' --backend glx -b\\n```\\n\\nAnother idea I had to help fix my problem was to selectively dim brighter\\npixels, while keeping dimmer pixels unchanged.  I read that using the\\n[HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) color encoding could provide a\\ngood way to define what \\\"brighter\\\" means and a way to change it.  Luckily, \\nCompton provided a easy way to mess with this!  My fiddling can be found in the\\n[`compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl`](https://github.com/kovasap/compton/blob/94efb6c9a1f80e8dbf61409dfa9b476f15a06a16/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl#L64)\\nfile in my fork of the Compton repository. One thing I tried here was to use a\\nfunction like\\n[this](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+x+*+(1+-+a+*+x)+for+a%3D0,0.1,0.2,0.3,+x%3D0.0..1.0)\\nto map the \\\"value\\\" (V in HSV) to a dimmer value (notice how higher `V` values\\nare \\\"dimmed\\\" more than lower ones).  \\n\\nOne fun tool for this experimentation was a color picker like\\n[this](https://alloyui.com/examples/color-picker/hsv.html) one.  When changing\\nthe shader, the 2d color picker would have its colors changed, verifying the\\nchange made in the shader!  For example, after setting the shader to map `V`\\nvalues above 0.8 to 0.0, I could see the part of the color picker with those\\nvalues turn black.\\n\\nIn the end, I may just stick with selectively dimming entire bright windows\\nglobally, as opposed to dimming certain colors.  But it was fun to mess with and\\nI may return to it in the future!\\n\\nAnother thing to try going forward would be other color representation models,\\nsuch as [CIELAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) or\\n[YCbCr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr).\\n\\nUPDATE: One promising solution is https://github.com/yshui/picom/pull/247. This\\nfeature for picom (a fork of compton) gets an average brightness for a window\\nby averaging the colors of all its pixels, then dims the window if that\\nbrightness is above a threshold. It didn't work super well in my hands, but is\\nin theory a better solution to this problem than dimming all windows of a\\ncertain app.\\n\\n#### On Windows\\n\\nBecause I often game on windows, I prefer to have my secondary monitor be dimmer\\nthan the primary to not distract from the game I'm playing, but still be there to\\nlook stuff up.  I use the exellent [Pangolin Screen Brightness](https://www.pangobright.com/)\\nutility to do this.\\n\\n\\n## TODO\\n\\nTo link this documentation more with my actual config, one idea is to add\\nsomething like this to all the settings I document in my rc files:\\n\\n```\\n## SETTING_NAME ##\\nsome code that applies a setting\\n## END ##\\n```\\n\\nThen, when I'm writing docs in this website I can simply reference the\\nSETTING_NAME instead of inlining the code.  To make this work I need to write\\ncode that parses all my rc files and constructs some kind of mapping from\\nSETTING_NAMES to the code (and the language to get syntax highlighting right and\\nthe filename).

Not only is it tiring, but I frequently\\nfail at it; some of the tasks will just evaporate from my memory, only to be\\nrecalled a day later (or when there is a serious problem stemming from the task\\nnot being done). This isn't helped by \\\"trying harder\\\". Doing so only makes me\\n\\\"panic-remember\\\" a task every 5 minutes or so, pulling me completely out of\\nwhatever else I was doing.\\n\\nTrying to remember tasks I've found also has a large negative impact on my\\nsleep quality. The cycle of \\\"panic-remembering\\\" leads to me sleeping lightly\\nand waking up whenever the remembering happens.\\n\\n## Mobile Reminders\\n\\nAn amazing solution to my above problem has been using reminders on my\\nsmartphone to keep tasks out of my head, but still make sure they are done.

Think of something that needs to be done, or be asked to do something by\\n   another person.\\n1. Add a task on my phone with a description of the work.\\n1. **Set a time on the task when I think I'll be free to tackle it.**\\n1. Get notified of the task at the time I set.\\n1. Do the task, or postpone it; or do some work towards the task and postpone\\n   it for later follow up.\\n\\nThis system works very well compared to e.g. a to-do list, because it\\nexplicitly considers what time I'll be in the right mindset and have the right\\ncontext to do each item. I don't need to periodically scan my list and\\nre-remember every task when figuring out what to do next.\\n\\nThis system also makes it easy to set recurring tasks, or tasks in the far\\nfuture (months to years away). I've never been able to consistently remember to\\ndo these kinds of tasks before using this system.\\n\\n## Building Habits\\n\\nSetting recurring reminders at specific times is also an extremely effective\\nway of building [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).

This could be\\ninto the air as speech, onto paper as writing, or into your body as any physical\\nactivity (e.g. dancing, biking, etc.).  In this model, pure professing involves\\nno self reflection or change whatsoever.  If there is adaptation to the\\nunpredictable physical world, it is through if/then branches that choose simply\\nbetween already constructed neural patterns.  \\n\\nBeing in this state requires some combination of practice or training to build\\nthe mental patterns, and a framework of assumptions that keeps the mind from\\nexamining what it is doing too closely.  \\n\\nIn the extreme, pure profession can be animalistic and stubborn. Being in a \\nprofessing state leads to confidence and strong ego.\\n\\nBeing in this state can be physically draining, but mentally I find I can be in this state for a long time before needing a break.\\n\\nPeople tend to express this state more the older they get (i think).\\n\\n\\n### Flow\\n\\nBeing in a strong professing state can lead to a \\\"flow\\\" state, where the world\\nis continually validating your stored patterns and it feels like everything is\\ngoing \\\"right\\\".  I believe this state enables the acts of greatest skill or\\ntalent that are possible for people.  This is a state of \u201ceffortless effort\u201d as described in Zen philosophy.\\n\\nI think the key to flow is to always have a readily accessible pathway for your mind to take when it runs into an issue.  Preparation/practice builds these pathways; it is easier to get into flow doing something you have done many times before.\\n\\n\\n## Absorbing - Learning - A State of Observation\\n\\nIn counter to profession, a state of absorption occurs when a mind is focused\\ninstead on taking in new information while making few/no assumptions about the\\nworld.  In this state, instead of continually acting, one continually\\nquestions, expanding the problem space without looking at its details.  This\\nhappens often when being exposed to new information or questioning assumptions\\none has about old information.  New mental connections and memories are being\\ncreated actively in this state.\\n\\nWhen in this state, a mind is very sensitive to any external feedback to\\ncorrect its action.  This can manifest as insecurity or anxiety if pressure is\\napplied during this state of mind.\\n\\nThis state of mind can be paralyzing, as it lays bare the overwhelming\\ncomplexity of everything as you continue to zoom out.  However, it also leads to\\ninteresting connections that you may not see otherwise.\\n\\nExtreme absorption/mindfulness can lead to analysis paralysis or meaningless\\ntheorizing that is too far removed from reality to be useful.  Also\\nprocrastination.\\n\\nYounger people tend to express this state more (i think).  This thought\\ninspired by \u201cHow to Change Your Mind\u201d by Michael Pollan.\\n\\nBeing in this state is very draining, as your mind has to constantly\\nreconfigure its thoughts reactively to match external feedback.  For me to be\\nmost effective, I need to take short and long breaks from this state (even\\n\u201csleeping on\u201d what I\u2019m learning) to solidify memories and make them\\n\u201cprofessable\u201d.  Too much raw absorption becomes counterproductive, as my mind\\nis too tired to even hold on to the recent changes, let alone make more new\\nones.\\n\\nWhen learning in this state, there will almost always be blind alleys you must\\ngo down to eventually find a model of (or perspective on) the world that works.\\nThis explains why learning can be such a \\\"stop and go\\\" process - it's easy to\\nbe stuck on a concept for a while before it finally clicks.  Also I think one\u2019s\\ntolerance for blind alleys directly correlates to how good they are at\\nlearning.\\n\\n- [Inversion by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/inversion)\\n  - Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to\\n    succeed.\\n\\n\\n## Switching states\\n\\nIn order to get better at something, both absorbing AND professing are equally\\nimportant often in alternating steps.  \\n\\nSee [this Skyline video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLloQvOv1W4) for a\\ndescription about how this process works for a game like Overwatch\\nspecifically.\\n\\nLearning how to do something new under pressure of your own or other\u2019s\\nexpectations can be hard.  Specifically, it is stressful to take mental\\npathways you have recently worked on as an absorber and apply them assuming\\nthey will work (with penalty for failure).  \\n\\nSomeone who \u201cthrives in ambiguity\u201d is bold about applying untested pathways and\\nhas a low fear of failure - or has set expectations properly such that failure\\nis not a big problem.  Alternatively, this person is willing to take on\\nperspectives and run with them even if there is a threat that their taken\\nperspective does not match the perspective/expectations of others they are\\nworking with.  \\n\\n\\n## Ideas to test\\n\\n - Do you actually have a worse memory for events that happened to you when in\\n   a professing state?\\n\\n# Focus\\n\\nThis is unrelated to the above states of mind.  \\n\\nOne way I think of focus is as getting buy in from your mind to fully engage in\\nsome work (mental or physical).  Often the mind expects some pay off for doing\\nthis, since it takes energy and time to be fully engaged.  [This\\nsnippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryB_VQ__KeE) by Jonathan Blow does a\\ngreat job describing how focus can be disrupted ([full\\ninterview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ej_3NKA3pk)).\\n\\nA good way to encourage focus is to set yourself up so that external \u201cthings I should also think about\u201d are absent.  For example:\\n\\n - Writing thoughts down so that your brain doesn\u2019t feel pressure to remember\\n   them (else they would be lost).\\n - Keeping your goals \u201cin front\u201d of you.  This could mean laying out your\\n   workspace so that all that\u2019s needed to do your task is at hand.  This could\\n   mean keeping opponents in a game within your field of view.  Being in a\\n   situation where you have to \u201cturn your head around\u201d physically or\\n   metaphorically to keep abreast can lead to breaks in focus.\\n - Putting walls up between yourself and other tasks, like by putting your\\n   phone in another room when trying to focus on something.\\n\\nAnother useful idea is to try to enumerate the things you want to do before\\nstarting on them.  If this list is written down (or even remembered), going\\nback to it can be a stimulus that competes with other environmental\\ndistractions or thoughts.  For instance, a common pattern I notice is (1) I\\ncomplete a task, (2) I have to refocus on something else, (3) some random\\nenvironmental stimulus grabs my focus (e.g. an email, article, chore).  When I\\nhave a list of things I want to do, then those become part of the set of\\nenvironmental stimuli, making it more likely that I do them instead of\\nsomething else.  This system is most effective when the list is very\\naccessible; this could mean physically at hand, or recently created so it is\\nfresh in your mind.  It also helps to consciously pause right after stage (1)\\nabove (completing a task), instead of directly jumping to the next thing with\\nlittle thought - this simple pause really helps your next task be intentional\\nand not dictated by your environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nCategories: [Mind]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Mind=true)\"\n    :name \"absorbing-and-professing.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 7480\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/mind/behavior-change.md\"\n    :title \"Behavior Change\"\n    :markdown \"# Behavior Change\\n\\nBuilding new habits is really important to making permanent improvement to your\\nlife.

One useful tool to avoid this is by constraining\\nyour problem space, sometimes dramatically.  For instance, what if you could\\nonly fold the page and do nothing else?  Suddenly, it's much easier (for me at\\nleast) to start just doing something. This helps a lot with \\\"Just Getting\\nStarted\\\".\\n\\nConstraining the problem space could also involve setting a hard deadline for\\nfinishing X in 30-60mins.  This will often introduce an urgency that can help\\nproduce something.\\n\\nAnother idea along these lines is to intentionally try to come up with the\\ndumbest solution/idea and start implementing it. Since you are intentionally\\ntrying to do a bad job, all the thinking and anxiety that comes when trying to\\ndo stuff right is removed, which may facilitate doing something which can later\\nbe polished.\\n\\n## Just Getting Started\\n\\nOnce you get on the path of creation, the small choices you encounter will\\ngenerally be much more manageable decisions, and through them something complex\\noften emerges.\\n\\n## Remixing\\n\\nOur minds create new things by mixing the old together.

In my opinion, art in any form is spectacularly useful\\nhere. One way to think about art is as an expression of (hopefully new) ideas\\nspecifically designed to appeal to human sensibilities - the perfect coupling\\nof novelty with a mechanism to get it to stick in your head.

If\\nsystems independently let students test out of courses, or offered testing\\nseparately from training, this problem might be solved to some extent.  Of\\ncourse, in this case the testing would have to be very good, and some things\\nare unfortunately hard to test for.  Project-based evaluation might be a good\\nway around this.\\n\\nSee https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/cs-degree/ for a great story about what a\\ntest-driven education could look like for a motivated individual.\\n\\n## High School as Survey\\n\\nIn my opinion, (at least my) high school education focused too much on\\nfulfilling prerequisites and teaching fundamental topics and too little on\\nsurveying possible areas of study and career paths. I believe this is due to\\nthe assumption that prerequisites are necessary for students to be able to\\nstudy higher level concepts (e.g. algebra before calculus before physics).\\nWhile this is strictly speaking true, it ignores the power of motivating\\ncontext.  By this I mean that if you want to learn how a ball moves through\\nspace in physics, it is very obvious how calculus is helpful towards achieving\\nyour goal.  However, if you are just learning calculus (or algebra!) without\\nthis context, it can feel like what you are learning is pointless (because it\\nis to you at that moment).\\n\\nTrying to learn complex topics without understanding why they are useful is\\nextremely difficult and leads to less memory retention of the things you\\nlearned if you end up do learning them. IMO this is one of the primary reason\\nmany people struggle in school. Conversely, if you DO have a strong reason to\\nlearn something, it is much easier to do so, and you may be able to pack much\\nmore learning into a shorter period of time.  Plus, the learning will be more\\nuseful, as it is already shown to have at least the one motivating use.\\n\\nNot only can focus on hierarchical prerequisites stifle learning rate, it also\\ndoes a disservice to students who are trying to figure out what to specialize\\nin at college (if they attend) and in their careers. I personally knew a lot of\\nabstract concepts in high school, and knew I was interested in STEM, but had\\npretty much no conception of the different types of STEM careers available to\\nme and what kinds of day-to-day work they each would entail. If half the time\\nspent in high school on academic classes was instead spent on career/field\\nsurvey talks/activities/classes, I would have been much better prepared to set\\nmyself up for a fulfilling life after graduation, and I would have been more\\nmotivated to independently study those careers/fields.\\n\\nAs it stands, I feel like I got extremely lucky to land in the jobs I did.  I\\nvery nearly joined a PhD program after college that in retrospect I'm quite\\ncertain I would have liked less than the companies I randomly was exposed to in\\nmy last years in college. It scares me that the only thing that saved me from\\nthis misstep was a random email on a mailing list I randomly joined, as opposed\\nto something built into the educational system.\\n\\n## Extended Education Concept\\n\\nIn high school and college I often felt extremely mentally busy. I was usually\\nin 5+ hours a day of classes teaching radically different things. Synthesizing\\nand remembering everything I was taught was difficult, and I fear that many of\\nthose hours were wasted simply because I didn't have the mental bandwidth to\\nget all the information to stick.\\n\\nPost-college, I feel like I have much more mental bandwidth for learning.  I'm\\nwell able to fill this with books, podcasts, and other online resources.\\nDespite this, I sometimes wonder if generally speaking formal education could\\ndo a better job of utilizing mental bandwidth over time.  By this I mean\\n\\\"hybridizing\\\" college and other pursuits more than they already are.\\n\\nFor example, instead of being a full time vocation, college could instead\\ninvolving taking 1 class per quarter/semester and spending the rest of one's\\ntime working or doing whatever else you would otherwise do post-graduation.\\nThis would lead to college taking longer to provide the same level of\\neducation.\\n\\nThis could cause problems for people who want to start a skill-requiring job\\nas soon as possible. I wonder if it's possible to front-load practical\\nprerequisites early in the education cycle for such jobs. In my experience in\\ntechnical fields so far, there are only a few requirements I've truly needed\\nfrom my education; otherwise most of my skills have been learned on the job.\\n\\nCategories: [Mind]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Mind=true)\"\n    :name \"education.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 4804\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/mind/how-to-do-hard-tasks.md\"\n    :title \"How To Do Hard Tasks\"\n    :markdown \"# How to Do Hard Tasks\\n\\nThis goes hand-in-hand with [motivation]({{< relref \\\"/docs/mind/motivation.md\\\" >}}).\\n\\nhttps://every.to/superorganizers/how-to-do-hard-things is somewhat related.\\n\\n## What Makes Tasks Hard?\\n\\nTasks are hard when you don't already have pathways in your brain that script\\nthem, or your existing pathways are incomplete.  Doing hard tasks requires\\nlearning.\\n\\nhttp://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/\\n\\nOne way to model a task is as a tree of possibilities, where each node is a\\ndecision with any number of possible outcomes. Here I'll discuss tasks that are\\nhand because this tree is complex (has many nodes). Tasks can be hard for other\\nreasons (e.g. physically hard), but I wont discuss those here.\\n\\nTask trees can have many nodes because:\\n\\n1. There simply are many steps to take to complete the task,\\n1. Because some steps in the process are committing, making it so that you need\\n   to try to predict a lot of the future decisions that will come up in order to\\n   be confident in your decision (like playing a game of chess),\\n\\n\\n## What Makes Tasks Easy?\\n\\nTasks are easy when a pathway has already been constructed in your head to\\nexecute that task effectively (traverse the tree of decisions in a\\npredetermined way).\\n\\nIt's good to be cautious of tasks that you find to be easy.  In my experience\\nit's a human tendency to strongly defend the solutions to the tasks that one\\nholds (see [a reddit post about political\\nbeliefs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/iu865f/oc_i_did_some_presidential_economic_statistics_to/g5k93df/)\\nand Claire's old lab's observation that ideas/theories can become \\\"precious\\\"\\nonce created).  This makes sense, since it takes effort/time/resources to\\ncreate a task-solving pathway.  See also David Eagleman's neuroscience books,\\nwhich talk about this.  However, this strong defense can blind one to obvious\\nflaws or much better pathways.  It's probably a good habit to occasionally\\nre-learn from scratch originally hard tasks that are important to do well.\\n\\n\\n## Hard Task Solving Strategies - How to Learn\\n\\nLearning requires active exploration of the real world task tree for the task\\nyou want to learn to do.  Through this exploration, the tree is transcribed\\nfrom the real world into mental pathways.  So one way to think about learning\\nhard tasks is learning how to most efficiently explore/transcribe the task\\ntree.\\n\\n\\n### Questions\\n\\nSome parts of the task tree may already exist in your brain from another task\\nyou've done - for example, most of the muscle movement mental pathways needed\\nto run already exist in someone who knows how to walk.  Other parts may be\\ncompletely new, or even contradictory to existing mental pathways.  A very\\nefficient way to more quickly learn these alien pathways is to question them\\nvia:\\n\\n - Asking a task expert\\n - Asking a reference (e.g. A book or Google search)\\n - Tinkering with the task space (e.g. Attempting to run some computer code)\\n\\n\\n### Environmental Influence\\n\\nThe human brain constantly absorbs new information from its perspective on the\\nenvironment where it is.\\nFor learning therefore, it can be helpful to place oneself in an environment\\nconducive to learning what you want to learn.  This usually makes it more\\nobvious what questions to ask to further map out the task space.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/HammockDrivenDev.md\\n\\n\\n### Depth First Search of Task Tree\\n\\nPerhaps a preference of iNtuitive Myers-Briggs personalities, this can lead to\\nfast good solutions, but also blindness to obvious other paths.\\n\\n\\n### Breath First Search of Task Tree\\n\\nPerhaps a habit of Sensing Myers-Briggs personalities, this can lead to good\\nscoping of the task space, but may exhaust energy to \\\"go deep\\\" on a specific\\ntask solution.\\n\\nI think this is what Nassim Taleb advocates for doing more in complex task\\nspace.  He writes that exposing oneself to many decision points and giving\\noneself the option to travel will long term find one the most success.\\n\\n\\n### Mental Perspective\\n\\nThe brain only understands the world as it perceives it through the senses.\\nAlthough the senses can take in a high volume of information, there is still\\nheavy processing that must be done for this information to be useful/actionable\\nby the rest of the brain.  There are many points along this chain of processing\\nwhere learned perspective shapes what the rest of the brain sees.  For instance,\\nan image of an engine may just look like metal to an untrained brain, but tells\\na very different story to a mechanic.\\n\\nIn a way, learning or training is partially (or completely?) the process of\\nacquiring new perspectives from which to see the world.  This explains why\\nlearning can be such a \\\"stop and go\\\" process - it's easy to be stuck on a\\nconcept for a while before it finally clicks.\\n\\n- [Inversion by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/inversion)\\n  - Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to\\n    succeed.\\n\\nCategories: [Mind]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Mind=true)\"\n    :name \"how-to-do-hard-tasks.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/mind/motivation.md\"\n            \"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 5045\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/mind/influences.md\"\n    :title \"Influences\"\n    :markdown \"# Influences\\n\\nThese works have guided my thinking about how the mind works.

If your body/mind are primed to do the\\ntask such that you could do it with minimal/no conscious intervention.  For\\nexample walking, reading, or doing some trained skill are trivially easy.  Note\\nthat this depends on the current state of your body; walking may not be\\ntrivially easy if you are exhausted or have a broken leg.  And also the state\\nof your mind; responding to a conversation may be hard if you haven't caught up\\non what has been said.\\n\\nNote that the whole path to the objective does not have to be trivially easy or\\neven known.  All that matters where motivation is concerned is the next step\\n(at least for attainability).\\n\\nMotivation can flag when the next step towards a goal is unclear.  In such\\nsituations it's easy to simply switch gears to another activity which has clear\\nsteps - this is procrastination.\\n\\n### How to make things attainable\\n\\nWhen something feels unattainable because either (a) it seems so hard you would\\nfail if you tried or (b) its unclear what step to take next, I have found\\nseveral tricks that work pretty well:\\n\\n#### Thinking Creatively\\n\\nSee [thoughts on creativity]({{< relref \\\"/docs/mind/creativity.md\\\" >}}).\\n\\n#### Taking a Step Back\\n\\nTaking a step back both from the problem at hand AND from anything else that\\nengages your mind.  The goal here is to put yourself in a state of boredom, then\\nslightly nudge your thoughts toward your issue.  Often I find my mind much more\\neagerly thinks about something when the prospect of boredom is there as an\\nalternative.  One way to do this is by going and sitting in another chair far\\nfrom distractions.\\n\\nAnother alternative is going for a walk or run, preferably with no audio or\\nother distractions.  This method also usually engages my creativity, which\\nhelps open up new potential paths to issue resolution.  There is the drawback\\nthat sometimes here my creativity will wander, and I will end up with good\\nideas about something other than my issue.\\n\\n#### Talking it Out\\n\\nTalk to someone (or yourself) about the issue.  Sometimes the act of putting\\nyour issue into works can snap some clarity into it.  The person you are\\ntalking to may also offer useful insights.  Writing thoughts down can also\\nsometimes work here, if no-one is available to talk to.\\n\\nThis usually involves re-verifying the assumptions you've been making about the\\nproblem.\\n\\n#### Getting Psyched Up\\n\\nThis only applies when you find the task hard, but you see the path you would\\ntake to do it.  In this case, for me listening to energetic music or putting\\nmyself in an energetic, stimulating, or even stressful environment (e.g. with\\nother people around) can help me feel more active and therefore more able to do\\nmy hard task.  I think part of this is that the stimulation occupies the higher\\nlevel part of my mind that's telling me the task is hard, and just lets the less\\nconscious parts of me simply execute. Again, this only works for a case (a)\\nabove, **not** when it's unclear what to do next.  See the book \\\"Antifragile\\\"\\nfor more on this, specifically Book 1 Chapter 2.\\n\\n#### Making Concrete Sub-Tasks\\n\\nOne highly effective way to keep something consistently attainable is to break\\nit into smaller, concrete pieces that are each attainable even to a tired or\\ndistracted mind. The actual act of doing this can be very difficult, so this\\nisn't a great solution when you are already finding your motivation flagging.\\nThis strategy shines when you let your past self do this for you when it is\\nenergized and fresh. Of course, your past self wont have the direct motivation\\nto do this (as it's doing fine) so it helps to set reminders for yourself to do\\nthis work when you are fresh.\\n\\n#### TODO add a reference to the manifesto \\\"vision\\\" section here, or merge the sections\\n\\n### How to make things LESS attainable\\n\\nWhen stuck on attainability, there are several counterproductive strategies:\\n\\n**Eating food** in hopes that it will give you energy to push through.  This\\nalways just makes me MORE tired especially in the short term.  Plus I usually\\nfeel more able/energetic when I am slightly hungry.\\n\\n**Trying to brute force** your way through an issue without trying alternate\\nroutes.  This sometimes works, but usually just makes me feel stupid and can\\nlead to a vicious cycle where I continually burn more and more energy in less\\nand less well directed ways trying to prove I am not stupid :).  The key to\\navoiding this is making sure you aren't following the same lines of thought\\nover and over, and stopping if you find yourself doing so.\\n\\nThe tendency to try to brute force I find is more and more temping the most\\ntired you are.  One way to explain this is that as you do something hard (that\\nyou don't already have mental circuits to handle) , your mind contracts/focuses\\non the problem until it becomes so rigid that even the slightest unexpected\\nevent (or new solution idea) is hard to handle.  This is counter to an\\n\\\"expanded\\\" mind where many possibilities are open and easy to handle.  If you\\nhave been focusing hard on one thing, a way to expand your mind is to do\\nsomething you might find boring and let your mind wander its way to expansion.\\nAs discussed earlier, going for a walk or otherwise exercising I find hastens\\nthis process.  So going for a walk with no stimulation (no reading on phone, no\\nlistening to anything, no conversations with people) is a great technique.\\nSome of this is inspired by the last part of Chapter 5 of \\\"How to Change Your\\nMind\\\" by Michael Pollan.\\n\\n\\n## (Perceived) Meaning\\n\\nActivities are meaningful when they fit neatly into a larger narrative.  This\\ncould be a grand narrative about one's identity (e.g. defined by what [virtues\\nyou aspire to or possess](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths)),\\nor a myopic narrative about what puzzle piece should fit next into the puzzle\\nto bring it closer to solution.\\n\\nWhat you or others may find meaningful in a certain situation varies a lot for\\nmany reasons.  I have found myself obsessed with completing certain goals, and\\nthen having my obsession and motivation completely evaporate after reframing\\nthe larger context those goals fit into.\\n\\nOne way to lose motivation for a task is to follow the meaning of the task up\\nthrough all the ways it impacts the world, coming to the final conclusion that\\nthere is no greater meaning in the world (or you don't know what it is), and\\ntherefore the task itself is meaningless.  This kind of \\\"bubbling up\\\" can\\nhappen on a smaller scale as well.\\n\\nTODO explore ideas from\\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-learn-faster-when-we-arent-told-what-choices-to-make/\\n\\nThere are many sources of meaning (just see the above linked virtues list). Some\\nof the sources that are strong for me personally:\\n\\n1. Proving competence. This involves demonstrating to myself and others that I\\n   can overcome difficult challenges. What the challenge actually is isn't\\n   really that important, only that I can succeed at it where others (including\\n   my past self) fail.\\n\\n\\n## Holding loosely and Ego\\n\\nBecoming highly personally invested in a task often surfaces a lot of\\nparalyzing emotions like fear of failure. Even for work that could be\\nlife-changing, I find \\\"holding loosely\\\" or not caring too much about the\\noutcome is a highly effective strategy.  This frees your mind up to perform in\\nthe moment, which will often be what determines the ultimate result of the\\nwork.\\n\\nThis mindset avoids the problem of focusing on things not in your control\\n(explored in [this gamedev post about\\nSNKRX](https://www.a327ex.com/posts/snkrx_log/#control)). By definition, this\\nthinking can't directly lead to positive action that would improve your\\nsituation. The best it can do is _maybe_ make you stumble upon some new\\ninformation if you are doing research about the thing not in your control, but\\nmuch more often I find that it leads to dead-end thoughts that make you lose\\nmotivation entirely.\\n\\nI found this concept to be extremely helpful when interviewing for jobs. Here\\nthis is particularly relevant because interviewing involves being social with\\nyour interviewer, and having a positive social interaction usually requires\\nsharing positive emotions.  It's much easier to do this if you are actually\\nfeeling these emotions, and not faking them while internally feeling fear or\\npanic.\\n\\nThis concept is really helpful in sports too, or anything that requires high\\nin-the-moment performance.  In fact, I was first introduced to this concept\\nwhen playing tennis.  I was taught to hold my racket like a tube of toothpaste -\\nif I squeezed too hard (get too tense), the toothpaste would come out.  This\\nrelaxed physical state is tightly coupled to a relaxed mental state of being\\n\\\"in the moment\\\".\\n\\nOne great exploration of this is the concept of \\\"effortless effort\\\" in Zen\\nphilosophy.  I was first introduced to this by the book [Zen in the Martial\\nArts by Joe\\nHyams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424340.Zen_in_the_Martial_Arts).\\nThere are also some good thoughts about this in [Zen Mind, Beginners Mind by\\nShunryu Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Mind,_Beginner%27s_Mind).\\n\\nSee [my thoughts on creativity]({{< relref \\\"/docs/mind/creativity.md\\\" >}}) for\\nmore exploration of related ideas.\\n\\n## Expectations\\n\\nFor me, the hardest part of executing on goals is getting my entire brain on\\nboard to apply effort towards my current goal.  The best way I've found to do\\nthis so far is by keeping the quality of the final product out of my head.  In\\nother words, I try to not have expectations for a specific result or, if that's\\ntoo hard, I at least try to keep my expectations low.\\n\\nNot worrying about my goal's final product makes it much easier to just start\\ndoing something.  My ego is protected from failure, and I can utilize all the\\nparts of my brain that live in the moment.  Usually, the best final products\\nare honed as they are made anyway - attempting to plan out the perfect product\\nfrom the start without getting feedback from the work often just leads me to a\\nstate of analysis paralysis.\\n\\nThe expectations of others are often even more extreme of a factor than my own\\nexpectations. For example, if I am given a task (or collaboratively come up\\nwith a task) that is perceived as very difficult or impossible, any progress at\\nall will make me extremely motivated to continue. Conversely, if a task is seen\\nas trivial to accomplish, I may not be motivated to start right away or, worse,\\nI will feel very stressed if it ends up taking longer than expected.\\n\\n## Execution\\n\\nSome great resources for goal execution:\\n\\n - https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html\\n - https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits\\n\\n## See Also\\n\\n - https://guzey.com/productivity/\\n - http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity\\n - Meditation to help when getting overwhelmed:\\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7kh8pNRWOo\\n - Work specific motivation: https://jasont.co/ennui/\\n\\n\\nCategories: [Mind]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Mind=true)\"\n    :name \"motivation.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/mind/creativity.md\"\n            \"/docs/mind/creativity.md\"\n            \"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 11375\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/mind/myers-briggs-personality-typing.md\"\n    :title \"Myers Briggs Personality Typing\"\n    :markdown \"# Myers-Briggs Type Indication (MBTI)\\n\\n## Extroverted - Introverted\\n\\n## Intuitive - Observant\\n\\nOne perspective: If your brain is trying to build a wall of information, a more\\n**Observant** mind will use bricks it finds with its senses in the world around\\nit (either via memories or present sensations).

Everyone involved must take their\\nmodels out of their heads so that others can amend their own models in an\\neffort to reach some kind of consensus.  This is hard work and is not always\\ntreated as such.\\n\\nNot only is it hard work to do this model-sharing, but it can create [cognitive\\ndissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), which causes\\npain.  This can necessitate further model-sharing to resolve, which can balloon\\na small issue into a massive ordeal.  I like this quote from Valarie Kaur:\\n\\n   \\\"Deep listening is an act of surrender. We risk being changed by what we hear.\\\"\\n\\nTo expect people to readily do this is in my opinion expecting too much.  Of\\ncourse, putting effort into this process is necessary for many types of work;\\nlots of problems arise when someone is not willing to *ever* do this.\\n\\nThis article does a good job of providing a methodology for resolving friction\\naround model-sharing:\\n\\nhttps://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-resolve-a-conflict-when-both-sides-are-right-1f375bc82f7f\\n\\n\\n## Emotional Consensus and Disagreement {#emotional-conversations}\\n\\nPeople are very sensitive to emotions of others (accurately understood or not)\\nin conversations. This is especially true of negative emotions. Because of\\nthis, it can very easily become the goal of a conversation to help resolve\\nnegative emotions present in your conversation partner. This can be good, but\\ncan also be a problem if your are mis-reading your partner's emotions or if\\nthey don't want those emotions resolved. I think it's good to be aware of this\\ntendency and catch yourself if you see issues arising because of it.\\n\\nRelated, one thing I've noticed that sparks involved discussions (or heated\\narguments) is lack of **emotional** consensus on a topic. I've had several\\ntalks where it seems like I agree with my conversation partner, but there is\\nstill an unresolved tension in the air. This tension existed because, although\\nwe clarified facts, we still had different emotional reactions to the topic,\\nimplying that we hadn't created a fully shared perspective. Identifying that\\nthis is the root cause of the tension can be a good way to get to the bottom of\\nthe disagreement.\\n\\n\\n## Pitfalls in Productive Conversations\\n\\nIf we say a \\\"productive conversation\\\" is one where people are trying to find\\nconsensus on a particular question, there are a couple patterns that can make\\nthese conversations take much more time and energy to achieving their goal:\\n\\n### Having unclear definitions\\n\\nIt can sometimes be easy for a lot of conversation to happen before the\\nparticipants realize that the definitions they are assuming are not the same\\nfor the relevant terms/concepts. It's usually worth the time to get core\\ndefinitions really nailed down before moving past them into what effects they\\nhave on other concepts.\\n\\n### Exploding the Scope\\n\\nOften conversations lead to tangents that might be even more interesting to\\nsome participants than the original conversation. Being explicit about when\\none is making a jump to discussing a tangent can be really helpful for several\\nreasons:\\n\\n1. The other participants may not care about the tangent.\\n1. The other participants may feel like the tangent-follower is assuming that\\n   they believe something about the tangent based on the previous conversation,\\n   when that's actually not true. \\n\\nA common reason for following a tangent is when trying to argue for a\\nparticular viewpoint, and not finding a good path forward with the current\\nargument. For instance, take an example where one is arguing why book X is\\nbetter than a similar book Y.  They might start by describing why they think\\nthe main character is more relatable, but then shift into talking about the\\nworld being more fleshed out when they run out of points. This can be jarring\\nif the other participants are still thinking about character-relatableness, and\\nfeel like the tangent-follower is just glossing over their own points. Worst\\ncase, the tangent follower can to this intentionally to confuse their\\n\\\"opponents\\\" to \\\"win\\\" a debate.\\n\\n\\n## [Reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology))\\n\\nPeople inherently like to be in control of what happens to them in their lives.\\nWhen this control is threatened, resistance to the threat is the natural\\nresponse. I definitely have felt this when in a situation where someone tells\\nme to do something - even something I know I want to do. The very fact that I\\nwas told to do it makes me _less_ interested in doing it! Sometimes this effect\\ncan be extreme.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons why micromanagement of others leads to all sorts of\\nproblems. It is much more motivating to let people come to their own decisions\\nabout whether to do something if possible. \\n\\nIn my experience, learning is also easier when the topic of study is not\\ndictated to me, but instead I explore it \\\"freely\\\". Even reading a linear\\ntextbook can feel free (and I absorb the information better) when I set the\\npace and am able to jump around at will.\\n\\n### Circumventing Reactance\\n\\nSometimes you still need to tell people what to do to effectively get things\\ndone. For cases where reactance is strong, creating an environment in which a\\nperson can explore and independently come to your conclusion for what needs to\\nbe done may be an effective strategy. This has the added benefit (?) of\\nallowing them to come to an even better conclusion than your own!\\n\\n\\n## Assuming Good Intentions\\n\\nIt's pretty hard sometimes to figure out why someone is doing something in\\nparticular.  [This clip from Malcolm in the Middle about changing a light\\nbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0) is a pretty funny extreme\\nexample, but I find this kind of situation comes up in smaller ways fairly\\noften. If you must have expectations for someone doing something for you (which\\nare best avoided entirely), it's good to keep in mind that their approach is\\nprobably going to be different from yours in ways that are hard to predict.\\nTrying to figure it out - or worse, micromanage them - may often be wasted\\neffort and lead to interpersonal frustration.\\n\\n\\n## Complaining\\n\\nPeople complain for at least two main reasons:\\n\\n1. They need help with something.  Either via:\\n    1. Direct help (offloading their problem in part to someone else).\\n    1. Advice help (having another person help improve their understanding of\\n       their problem, so that they can solve it alone without transferring any\\n       responsibility).\\n    1. In \\\"How to Change your Mind\\\" by Michael Pollan this was described as a\\n       \\\"doing\\\" behavior.\\n1. They want to share their feelings so that others around them are on the same\\n   page about their emotional state.  This is helpful e.g. so others around\\n   them will not burden them further, unaware of their current burden.  This is\\n   also helpful for emotional validation reasons - it is useful to know if the\\n   thing you are upset about upsets others; if not, perhaps you are missing an\\n   easy resolution to your problem.\\n    1. In \\\"How to Change your Mind\\\" by Michael Pollan this was described as a\\n       \\\"being\\\" (in the moment) behavior.\\n\\nIt is easy (at least for me) to jump strait to advice help when people complain\\naround me and ignore the fact that the complainer may need one of the other\\ntypes of resolution described above.\\n\\nCategories: [Mind]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Mind=true)\"\n    :name \"working-with-others.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Mind\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 7498\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/morality/cancelling-high-contributors.md\"\n    :title \"Cancelling High Contributors\"\n    :markdown \"# Cancelling Highly Productive People\\n\\nUnfortunately, it seems like some highly productive people that have\\npermanently improved the lives of millions of people are also either not very\\nsocially aware and/or are downright abusive to their colleagues.

Could very well have\\nlarge holes in it, but currently has a large influence on how I make decisions.\\n\\n## Assumption 1: Our goal is to maximize positive emotions.\\n\\nOur goal is to maximize the amount of time people feel positive emotions:\\n\\n - happiness\\n - fulfillment\\n - satisfaction\\n - empowerment\\n - energy\\n\\nAnd minimize the time spent feeling negative emotions:\\n\\n - pain\\n - depression\\n - apathy\\n\\nSince this is our goal, I'll define a \\\"moral\\\" act as an act that helps further\\nthis goal.\\n\\n\\n## Assumption 2: Emotions are personal reactions to experiences.\\n\\nEmotions arise when an experience is having positive or negative effects on\\nyou or people/things you care about (as far as you perceive it). \\n\\nEmotions are **not** intrinsically tied to specific experiences. For instance,\\ndepending on the person and their context, the experience of swimming can\\ninduce a wide variety of emotions:\\n\\n - fear\\n - exhaustion\\n - empowerment\\n - adventure\\n - relaxation\\n\\nThese same emotions can be induced by a wide variety of other experiences.  **No\\nexperience has a \\\"monopoly\\\" on specific emotions**, except for very low level\\ndrives (like eating satisfying hunger, drinking satisfying thirst, etc).\\n\\n\\n## Assumption 3: Experience-having requires resource destruction (cost), which often has negative emotional cost.\\n\\nMost experiences require some destruction of resources to have. All experiences\\nrequire the experiencer's time at the very least, but many also require:\\n\\n1. The work of other people.\\n1. A share of a finite resource.\\n\\nIn our society, we use money as a proxy for these resources, and spend that\\nmoney on experiences, quantifying this exchange. Money that goes unspent can be\\nused to have more personal experiences in the future, given to others so\\nthey can do the same, or used to build a system that makes future\\nexperience-having cheaper. \\n\\n\\n## Assumption 4: There is a lower cost threshold required for good experiences.\\n\\nEveryone needs to eat, drink, and fulfill other basic needs to not suffer large\\namounts of negative emotions (and die). These experiences have a cost, although\\nit can be very low. One outlier is medical care, but the minimum necessary cost\\nof this is controversial.\\n\\n\\n## Assumption 5: Emotional effects of an experience are uncoupled to cost past their lower threshold.\\n\\nPast the lower threshold for basic need type experiences, my observation is\\nthat the emotional effects of experiences are not well correlated to their\\ncost. Rather, they are primarily influenced by the context of that experience\\nin life. Some anecdotes:\\n\\n### Media\\n\\nThe excitement or other emotional reaction to media (books/movies/games) comes\\noften from:\\n\\n - Nostalgia\\n - What media one has consumed in the past\\n - What one's been thinking about recently\\n - What friends are talking about (not necessarily what's new)\\n - Media quality. Luckily the globalization of entertainment means this does\\n   not have a large impact on individual user cost.\\n\\n### Physicality\\n\\nMost physical pleasures are almost entirely dependent on context:\\n\\n - Hunger can make almost any food taste good; fullness can make even the\\n   fanciest desert sickening.\\n - Sleep can be the most important thing in the world, or impossible to do.\\n - Sexual experiences can be amazing, or traumatic.\\n\\n### Novelty\\n\\nTrips to foreign lands or completely new experiences get their excitement from\\nnovelty.\\n\\n### Side Note: Lifestyle Inflation\\n\\nMany experiences get boring over time (they become less emotionally powerful).\\nA common tendency is to try to make them more interesting by dumping more\\nresources into them in an effort to \\\"upgrade\\\" them. This is convenient because\\nit allows one to feel the comfort of familiarly with the experience while\\ngetting the thrill of novelty at the same time.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this can get very expensive and, even worse, can leave one at a\\nnew baseline of cost to uphold the new normal of these experiences. At this\\npoint, trying to downgrade will usually cause negative emotional reaction,\\nwhich is counter to our goal.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion: Living efficiently is morally optimal.\\n\\nI define efficiency as the ratio of maximum positive emotionality achieved to\\nthe cost required to achieve that emotionality. I argue that the best way to\\nmeet our original goal is to maximize the efficiency of our lives. This will\\nallow the greatest number of people to meet their lower threshold experience\\ncosts, and leave resources left over to make it even easier to meet this cost\\ngoing forward.\\n\\nWasteful activities, which are high cost but produce the same emotional return\\nas lower cost activities, are therefore to be avoided as much as possible.\\nTheir cost indirectly takes resources away from places where those resources\\nwould be much more emotionally powerful. This can be extreme; people spend many\\ntimes a basic income requirement on experiences commonly :(.\\n\\nCategories: [Morality]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Morality=true)\"\n    :name \"efficient-living-and-morality.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Morality\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 5001\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/morality/right-to-risk.md\"\n    :title \"Right To Risk\"\n    :markdown \"# Right to Risk\\n\\nReading https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity made me think\\nabout how much **personally** dangerous/risky behavior we should legally allow.\\nShould we allow unhealthy eating?

I think\\nas I learn the Clojure standard library of functions better, this will become\\neasier with time and ultimately I will be implementing less stuff myself than I\\nwould be in Python.\\n\\nCategories: [Software Dev]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Software-Dev=true)\"\n    :name \"functional-programming.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Software Dev\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 1131\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/software-dev/impact.md\"\n    :title \"Impact\"\n    :markdown \"# Impact\\n\\nDoing the right thing is infinitely more important than doing something.\\n\\n - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28025693\\n\\nCategories: [Software Dev]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Software-Dev=true)\"\n    :name \"impact.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Software Dev\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 209\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/software-dev/influences.md\"\n    :title \"Influences\"\n    :markdown \"## Influences\\n\\n- [Getting things done by Johnathan Blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCzrKjbXZQY)\\n  - Depth first approach to problem solving can be bad because you end up going\\n    in the wrong direction (which you would have avoided going breath-first)\\n- [Simple made Easy by Rich Hickey](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/)\\n  - Complex = entangled = difficult to reason about\\n  - To make systems more understandable, need to reduce them to small,\\n    **independant** pieces (like pure functions with no side effects)\\n- [Hammock Driven Development by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)\\n  - Stepping back from a problem and doing other things or sleeping allows\\n    unconscious parts of your mind draw connections that you otherwise wouldn't\\n    draw.

Each neuron\\nwould have multiple other neurons connected to it's \\\"input\\\" side, and connect\\nto one other neuron as it's \\\"output\\\".  It would carry a single \\\"fire/no fire\\\"\\nsignal during every tick of time.  The signal would be \\\"fire\\\" if during the\\nlast tick more than half (or some percent) of the input signals were \\\"fire\\\",\\notherwise it would be \\\"no fire\\\".\\n\\nNeurons would be grouped arbitrarily into sub-networks with relatively few\\ninputs/outputs compared to the interconnections within them.\\n\\n## Evolution\\n\\nThe model would evolve using a random application of the following changes:\\n\\n1. A random neuron would move its output side to another random neuron, with a\\n   preference to move its output to neurons \\\"close\\\" to it, as judged by\\n   distance in the graph.\\n1. A random neuron would be replaced by a copy of another neuron group with the\\n   same number of inputs and a single random output.  This is simulating\\n   \\\"creativity\\\", or the combining of disparate ideas.  Another way to do this\\n   would be to connect a single neuron's output to the input of another group,\\n   although this may lead to situations where that new group becomes\\n   ineffective due to overloading of random inputs.\\n\\nEvolution can happen to a network during its normal running (it can learn on\\nthe fly).\\n\\nIt might be interesting to think more about the difference between \\\"learning\\\"\\nand \\\"evolution\\\" - perhaps at a certain point only \\\"learning\\\" will be allowed,\\nand not \\\"evolution\\\".

If the string is too short to work, repeat it or\\nsomehow compress the image so it works out perfectly.  \\n\\n### Synonym Finder\\n\\nA program (or text editor plugin) where you can search text using all synonyms\\nof the words you typed to search.  For example, searching some documentation for\\n\\\"log\\\" would search for the word \\\"log\\\", but also (and with lower priority) the\\nwords \\\"stderr\\\", \\\"stdout\\\", \\\"output\\\", etc.  This could also just be build in to\\nthe search bar, where a window would pop up containing reframings of what you\\nsearched for, as suggestions for what else to try.  \\n\\n### See Through Walls with VR/AR\\n\\nTry to (using google maps or pre-collected data) model an object in the real\\nworld at its exact real world position in a VR or AR simulation.

This should reduce the number of flushes per day by a lot for the\\naverage toilet.\\n\\n### \\\"Feeling\\\" Biomarkers\\n\\nTry hooking up a continuous glucose (or other biomarker) monitor up to a\\nvibration arm band (as discussed in the book \\\"Livewired\\\" by David Eagleman) to\\n\\\"feel\\\" blood glucose concentration.\\n\\n\\n## Amusing\\n\\n### Musical Toothbrush\\n\\nA vibrating toothbrush that can accept a midi or other audio file.

This could be done on subreddits.\\n\\n### Regular Break Lifelogging\\n\\nEvery 30 minutes get up, walk around, and quickly note down what the last 30\\nminutes was spent doing. Then use that data for cool visualizations.\\n\\n### Tracking Digestion with Center of Mass\\n\\nUse body's center of mass to estimate digestion progress/state.  Presumably\\nright after eating mass is centered in the stomach, then slowly diffuses to\\nother parts of the body\\n\\n\\n## Food\\n\\n### Bell Pepper Cup\\n\\nCut the top off of a bell pepper and use it as a cup.  \\n\\n### Popped Potatoes\\n\\nPop potatoes like corn by wrapping them in a hard shell and cooking them.\\n\\n### Refried Bean Pizza\\n\\nPut refried beans on pizza.\\n\\n### Selling Chip Dust\\n\\nCompanies should sell the flavoring blends that flavor potato chips.\\n\\n\\n## Artistic\\n\\n### Monthly Clock Garden\\n\\nMake a circular (or square) yard with 12 plants that each bloom during each\\nmonth of the year.\\n\\n### Mood Ring Contacts\\n\\nContact for you eyes that change their color based on your mood.  For example,\\nred eyes could signify anger, black eyes depressions, blue eyes calm, green\\neyes joy, etc.\\n\\n### Encoding Vocal Inflection in Text\\n\\nIn March 2022 I started using text to speech converters to generate audiobooks\\nfor me to listen to on commutes. The biggest difference I noticed between robot\\naudio and a human reading out loud is that spacing between words and vocal\\ninflections don't always happen in the same way. For instance, a robot voice\\nmay not give weight to a sentence that a human would.\\n\\nIt would be neat if an author could somehow encode this vocal inflection in\\ntheir text (by using bold/italics or special characters) in such a way that a\\ntext to speech encoder could react to, to generate more natural sounding audio.\\n\\nPoets (or artistic authors) could even hijack this system to instead add\\nbizarre inflection to their text such that it would sound strange when\\ntext-to-speechified. I imagine you could do some pretty wild stuff here, from\\ncreating novel accents to spicing up rhyming verses. This technique would also\\nallow you to encode sounds in writing that are impossible for a human voice to\\nmake.\\n\\n### Laser Cut Leaves\\n\\nEtch some cool pattern in tough, large leaves (treating them like paper).\\n\\n### Laser Cut Flip Book\\n\\n#### Main Idea\\n\\nCreate a flip book by laser engraving a stack of thin wood (or thick paper)\\npieces, each with one frame of a gif or short video.  Then, create a box that\\nthe stack can fit into snugly, with one of the walls perpendicular to the stack\\nremoved.  In the place of that wall, put a mobile rod (or just make the wall\\nremovable).  If you then turn the box so that the rod or movable wall is facing\\nthe ground, you can remove the wall and let the pieces fall downward, advancing\\nthe frame and animating the gif/video.\\n\\n#### Variation\\n\\nMake the stack of frames, then drill a hole in one corner and thread a rod\\nthrough the stack.  You should be able to then rotate the stack around like a\\nspiral staircase.  Maybe you can animate it like this?\\n\\n### Table Fountain\\n\\nIf you have a round table to eat at that seats ~4 people, put a symmetrical\\nfountain like those found in gardens in the middle for people to use to refill\\ntheir water cups.  Could have four streams for easier filling.  \\n\\n\\nCategories: [Thought Experiments]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Thought-Experiments=true)\"\n    :name \"random-ideas.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Thought Experiments\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 7434\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/thought-experiments/two-glasses.md\"\n    :title \"Two Glasses\"\n    :markdown \"# Mixing Milk Tea\\n\\nGiven a glass of tea and a glass of (almond) milk, each 9/10ths full, how many\\ntimes would you need to mix the glasses for each to contain a 50% mixture of tea\\nand milk?\\n\\nThis python code:\\n\\n```\\nmax_size = 10\\na_volume, a_tea_fraction = 9, 1.0\\nb_volume, b_tea_fraction = 9, 0.0\\nmixes = 0\\nwhile a_tea_fraction > 0.51:\\n mixes += 1\\n print(mixes, a_tea_fraction, b_tea_fraction)\\n if a_volume != max_size:\\n   # Mix B into A\\n   amount_transferred = max_size - a_volume\\n   a_tea_fraction = (a_volume * a_tea_fraction\\n                     + amount_transferred * b_tea_fraction) / max_size\\n   a_volume = max_size\\n   b_volume -= amount_transferred\\n else:\\n   # Mix A into B\\n   amount_transferred = max_size - b_volume\\n   b_tea_fraction = (b_volume * b_tea_fraction\\n                     + amount_transferred * a_tea_fraction) / max_size\\n   b_volume = max_size\\n   a_volume -= amount_transferred\\n```\\n\\nsays this:\\n\\n```\\n1 1.0 0.0\\n2 0.9 0.0\\n3 0.9 0.18\\n4 0.756 0.18\\n5 0.756 0.2952\\n6 0.66384 0.2952\\n7 0.66384 0.36892800000000003\\n8 0.6048576 0.36892800000000003\\n9 0.6048576 0.41611392\\n10 0.5671088639999999 0.41611392\\n11 0.5671088639999999 0.4463129088000001\\n12 0.54294967296 0.4463129088000001\\n13 0.54294967296 0.465640261632\\n14 0.5274877906944 0.465640261632\\n15 0.5274877906944 0.47800976744448\\n16 0.517592186044416 0.47800976744448\\n17 0.517592186044416 0.4859262511644672\\n18 0.5112589990684262 0.4859262511644672\\n19 0.5112589990684262 0.49099280074525903\\n```\\n\\nGetting to complete 50-50 would take a very long time, but getting close takes\\nabout 16 mixes.\\n\\n## Follow up questions\\n\\nIf I only wanted to mix N times, how much milk tea can I make with two glasses\\nof fixed size?\\n\\nCategories: [Thought Experiments]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Thought-Experiments=true)\"\n    :name \"two-glasses.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Thought Experiments\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 1763\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/understanding-the-world/applying-theories.md\"\n    :title \"Applying Theories\"\n    :markdown \"# Applying Theories\\n\\n**NOTE: This is a very rough draft, and in some ways doesn't really make sense\\n: )**\\n\\nOne way to look at learning is as a cyclical process:\\n\\n1. Have some experiences in the world.\\n1. Mentally find commonalities between those experiences and create an abstract\\n   model in your head to help predict what might happen in a similar, future\\n   experience.\\n1. Test your model by having that future experience and seeing what happens.\\n1. Refine or discard the model as more experiences inform it.\\n\\nA key trap to avoid falling in to here is exiting the loop and believing that\\nyour model is \\\"the truth\\\". This assumes that all possible experiences have been\\nexplored, which is impossible.\\n\\nThe presence of this trap does **not** mean abstract theories are useless or\\nnot worth developing (because you will never find their solution). Abstract\\nmodels are in fact very useful as tools in your toolbox when approaching a new\\nexperience. They just must be applied as hypotheses, and held lightly.\\n\\nThis kind of thinking can be hard sometimes, because it sort-of involves\\nholding two conflicting ideas in your head ([which is\\npainful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance))[^1]. These are:\\n\\n[^1]: Note this this isn't the most common way the term cognitive dissonance is\\n  used - usually it explains the pain that directs people towards ignoring new\\n  information that conflicts with their existing beliefs.\\n\\n1. The theory explains how something abstract works.\\n1. The theory is only applicable in some concrete scenerios (and even then, may\\n   not be correct).\\n\\nThis is a bit of a paradox because to describe an abstract theory you\\nnecessarily must state that it works in an abstract context. They key is\\nrealizing that this explanation is incomplete. So you kinda have to \\\"believe a\\nlie\\\" in part to apply the theory.\\n\\n\\n## Example: Personality Typing\\n\\nOne very abstract theory is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)\\nfor personality typing. It attempts to condense the complexity of an individual\\nperson into a 4 letter code (4 binary dimensions) that describes their\\nbehavior. This is extremely abstract and incomplete.\\n\\nDespite the oversimplicity of MBTI, it can still be useful. For example, if two\\npeople are clashing because they are approaching a problem in two different\\nways (and each thinks their way is best), MBTI can give them a language with\\nwhich to see the validity of the other person's approach. Here the theory acts\\nas a neutral third party to help settle the dispute.\\n\\nIt could also not work in this situation at all depending on the people. The\\ndanger is believing too much that the theory is correct and trying to force\\nits application. This is where general theories become dangerous. The best\\napproach if the theory's application isn't leading to practically useful\\nresults (here helping the two people see eye-to-eye) is to move on to the next\\ntheory in the toolbox that could help.\\n\\n\\n## Giving Advice\\n\\nOften advice takes the form of an abstract adage or theory that the advice\\ngiver thinks will help the advice seeker. Just like with applying theories in\\nother ways, IMO advice is best given as a hypotheses; a \\\"this might help you\\\"\\nkind of statement.\\n\\nA lot of interpersonal tension and harm can come when the advice giver assumes\\nthat the theory 100% applies to the seekers situation. In this case, if the\\nseeker doesn't follow the theory, the giver would conclude that the seeker\\n\\\"just doesn't get it\\\" or is otherwise misinterpreting them. Then they might\\npush the theory and start to feel unheard or ignored. The issue here is that it\\nis really really hard to know what is going on in the seeker's mind (only they\\nmight know, but even that is not guaranteed).

Both help you make your own\\ndecisions:\\n\\n### Reason 1: To help you determine if you should make the same decision or not.\\n\\nThis is fairly straightforward: if someone else has already gone through the\\nwork of making a decision, it can be easier to try to judge their decision\\ninstead of coming up with your own from scratch. If you deem their decision\\ngood, then you can simply make it. Otherwise, you'll have a starting off point\\nfor making your own decision.\\n\\n### Reason 2: To help you determine if the decision maker is to be trusted with other similar decisions.\\n\\nA common concrete application is hiring. Interviews are ultimately trying to\\ndetermine if a candidate will be good at the job, which can be modeled as a\\nbunch of decisions. If the candidate is bad at making the decisions they will\\nneed to in their work, then they shouldn't be hired.\\n\\n## How?\\n\\nI think judging decisions is really tricky. The idea I outline here is just\\nthat: an idea. I don't claim that this is better than other methods, or that\\nit's even useful at all in practice.\\n\\nOne way to judge decisions is by seeing them as a tree of considerations. For\\nexample:\\n\\n- Should I vote for candidate X or Y?\\n - Which candidate will be better for the economy?\\n  - Which candidate will be better for my local economy?\\n - Which candidate's morals align more with my own?\\n - Which candidate do I think is more honest?\\n\\nFor many decisions, a massively complex tree of possibilities can be built.\\nWhen these trees are explored by decision makers, most of the exploration is\\nonly done in their heads, and only the parts deemed most important are\\nvocalized or written down when presenting the decision.\\n\\nI propose that one way to judge the quality of a decision is by the decision\\nmaker's ability to express their exploration of this tree. The fewer questions\\nyou can ask that are unanswered by the decision maker's justification, the\\nbetter.\\n\\nThis approach can be used in technical interviews, or judgment of someone's\\nwork (e.g. when evaluating performance), by asking yourself \\\"How much of the\\npossibility space has this person explored?\\\".\\n\\nCategories: [Understanding The World]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Understanding-The-World=true)\"\n    :name \"judging-decisions.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Understanding The World\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 2339\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/understanding-the-world/notetaking.md\"\n    :title \"Notetaking\"\n    :markdown \"# Notes on Notetaking\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- https://tkainrad.dev/posts/managing-my-personal-knowledge-base/\\n- https://vimways.org/2019/personal-notetaking-in-vim/\\n\\n## Graph Notetaking Idea\\n\\nUse a set of nodes connected to other notes in a graph (like\\n[zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)) to store knowledge.\\nEach note should have:\\n\\n - Constraints under which the notes info doesn't apply (limitation of a study)\\n - Some new knowledge, assuming the constraint\\n - References to other notes\\n\\nIn addition, the body of notes should contain guiding essays that string\\ntogether notes in an easy to understand way.

For example:\\n\\n - **Climate Change** could be solved if we all transitioned to using more\\n   renewable sources of energy.\\n - The **Obesity Epidemic** could be solved if we all ate less food.\\n\\n## Individual Change and Shaming\\n\\nOne common proposal I've heard for solving at least the above problems is using\\na \\\"grassroots\\\" approach. This method would involve first changing your own\\nbehavior such that the problem would be solved if everyone behaved like you,\\nthen trying to influence others to adopt your new behavior(s). This seems\\nsimple enough, but I don't think it's the best way forward, and in some ways is\\nactively harmful.\\n\\nThe tacit assumption with this proposal is that people are able to choose what\\nbehaviors to adopt. I would argue that in fact our behaviors are much more\\ninfluenced by our environment than we would like to admit. One component of our\\nenvironment is indeed other people peer pressuring us, but (IMO) far more\\ndominant factors include:\\n\\n - Economics (how much the behavior change costs)\\n - \\\"At hand\\\"-ness (what other behaviors are \\\"at hand\\\" and easy to do)\\n\\nWhen these factors are overpowering (which I argue they usually are), peer\\npressure becomes a form of bullying and social rejection that the target of\\nwhich is powerless to stop. Perpetuating this is downright cruel.\\n\\n## Changing the Environment\\n\\nIf a grassroots behavior change movement isn't the best way to solve the\\nproblem, then what can we do instead?  In my opinion, the answer is\\nenvironmental change. This can take several forms:\\n\\n### 1. Local Environmental Change\\n\\nThis involves making changes to an individual's local environment (the spaces\\nthey interact with on a habitual basis) to guide them to certain behaviors.\\nSome examples would be intentionally not buying unhealthy food when at the\\ngrocery store so that when at home these foods are not \\\"at hand\\\". Or not buying\\na car so that you instead need to bike or bus to get around.\\n\\nNote that the line here can be pretty blurry between what is an actual behavior\\nchange and what is simply an action that changes one's environment. Because of\\nthis, I think the stronger, ultimate solution is:\\n\\n### 2. Policy-Level Environmental Change\\n\\nGovernment policies can create massive environmental changes. For example,\\nextra taxes on certain products can massively impact people's buying decisions.\\nOr bans of certain products can completely change the suite of chemicals that\\nindividuals are exposed to on a daily basis.\\n\\nA natural objection is to point out that in a democracy, the majority of people\\n(in theory) choose what policies are enacted. Because of this, wouldn't people\\njust vote for policies that help them perpetuate their current behavior set -\\nwhich they presumably \\\"chose\\\" and/or otherwise would like to keep?\\n\\nI argue that actually **people are quite able to vote in a way counter to their\\neveryday actions**. For instance, people who enjoy soda may vote for a\\nsugar-sweetened beverage tax. The reason why (I think) this is because the\\nmental state you adopt when voting is generally different that the mental state\\nwhen deciding - or not consciously deciding at all - to engage in a particular\\nbehavior.\\n\\nThis is especially true when voting on higher level, more abstract policies.\\nFor instance, banning a certain type of energy production might indirectly\\nincrease someone's cost of living by quite a bit in various ways, but thinking\\nabout the policy in a more abstract sense may lead someone to approve it\\ndespite this personal impact.\\n\\nBased on my own emotions, I also think that people by and large care deeply\\nabout how their lives compare to those of others around them.  A tax that\\ngreatly increases everyone's cost of living is much more bearable than one that\\ntargets just an individual person. It's much rarer for people to worry about\\ntheir absolute standing than how they compare to others - the fact that the\\nmajority of people today live like the elites of a couple centuries ago is not\\na great source of comfort and satisfaction generally speaking.\\n\\nThis, like many solutions to big problems, does depend on an educated populace\\nthat is able to reason about the effects of certain policies. Ensuring this\\ncondition is itself a large scale societal problem that hopefully can be solved\\nwith this same line of thinking. I do admit there's a bit of a chicken-and-egg\\nproblem here :/.\\n\\n#### Externality-based Policies\\n\\nMany societal problems are due to hard-to-track externalities of existing\\nbehaviors that are not \\\"priced in\\\" to the cost of the behavior. For instance,\\ncompanies that make unhealthy food do not pay for the healthcare costs their\\nproducts incur. Or single-use plastic producers do not pay for waste cleanup\\nefforts. Or petroleum refiners do not pay for CO2 emissions. If these\\nexternalities were priced in, then the consumer would have a much easier time\\nmaking buying decisions, as the real cost of their consumption would be obvious\\nto them.\\n\\nCurrently, it's hard to know the real cost of a given behavior, which is\\nfurther confused by emotional arguments on either side. For example, if you\\nwant to know if you should use plastic straws or not, the low price of them\\nmight make you think they are an efficient way to solve your problem. But\\nothers would argue that [some large number] of straws are used every second!\\nUnfortunately, that doesn't really tell you very much. If instead it cost a\\ndollar to clean up every discarded straw, and that was priced into the straws\\ncost since the producing company had to clean up the straws, then you as the\\nconsumer could make a more informed decision about whether that dollar is worth\\nit.\\n\\nOf course, tracking all these externalities is hard. But this seems like a\\nuseful framework, or at least more useful that trying to get consumers to all\\nindividually understand the externalities of their actions.\\n\\nProbably someone else somewhere has done a much better job exploring this\\ntopic.\\n\\n### 3. Technological Environmental Change\\n\\nNew technologies dramatically change the environment people live in.\\nInterestingly, they usually do this without requiring the bureaucracy required\\nto enact government policies. Therefore, the development of new technologies to\\nsolve societal problems, like geoengineering techniques for climate change,\\nhas a lot of potential. And some problems can **only** be solved with new\\ntechnologies (like preventing aging).\\n\\n### 4. Cultural Environmental Change\\n\\nShifting cultural norms also can lead to massive change in individual behavior.\\nI don't really know the best way this can be leveraged without the \\\"grassroots\\\"\\nproblem I mentioned above, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.\\n\\n## Personal Impact\\n\\nGiven this theory, if someone feels strongly that certain problems need to be\\nsolves, what should they do?\\n\\nInfluencing government policy is a lot of work and is, I would argue, a task\\nthat requires specialized skills. This means that someone who invests more time\\nin building these skills will hone them, and have more leverage when applying\\nthem. Therefore, an effective path to personally solving societal problems is\\nto invest a lot of time and energy in honing and applying these skills. Note\\nthat I'm not talking about lobbying here, but rather actually writing laws and\\ndoing the research that motivates their creation and design. This kind of\\nenvironment building can also be done outside of formal government in private\\norganizations that fill some roles that a government might otherwise fill.\\n\\nOur hypothetical person could also get deep into creating a technology that\\nsolves the problem they care about. This arguably takes even more time/energy\\ninvestment to see significant returns.\\n\\nFor those who do not want to, or cannot, invest time/energy in influencing\\npolicy or developing new technologies, one fallback option is to instead hone\\nanother set of skills, apply them to make money, and then fund\\npolicymakers/inventors with the proceeds. This will probably have a bigger\\nimpact than dabbling in invention/policymaking, and certainly will have a\\nbigger impact than just changing your own behavior.\\n\\n### Hypocrisy\\n\\nIf you assume that \\\"grassroots\\\" individual change has little to no impact on\\nsocietal problems, then a lot of seemly hypocritical behavior is explained and\\neven excused. For instance, it is very reasonable to believe strongly that\\nsociety would be better if everyone was vegan, while eating the readily\\navailable non-vegan foods provided by society. It even makes some sense that\\nsomeone super passionate about some political issue - to the point where they\\norganize protests or voting campaigns - may not vote for the issue themselves!\\nIn my opinion, these behaviors are more a demonstration of how these\\nhypothetical people think they can manifest change as opposed to what they\\ntruly believe.\\n\\n## Testing this Theory\\n\\nRight now this line of thinking is just a plausible (at least to me) idea.  I\\nwould love to see some evidence for this, but don't have any at hand right now\\nto cite.  So (as always) I might be totally wrong :).\\n\\nCategories: [Understanding The World]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Understanding-The-World=true)\"\n    :name \"solving-societal-problems.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Understanding The World\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 9323\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/understanding-the-world/utopia.md\"\n    :title \"Utopia\"\n    :markdown \"# Achieving Utopia\\n\\n## Problems\\n\\nHumanity has some big problems that need to be solved before we can safely say\\nwe have built a utopia.\\n\\n### Wasted Human Potential\\n\\nMost people spend their productive time doing work that does not materially\\nmove our society forward.  As discussed later, people have the potential to\\ncreate completely new ideas that radically and positively improve the lives of\\nhumanity as a whole. Any work that does not leverage this potential by\\ndefinition wastes it, slowing our progress toward a utopia.\\n\\nIf our economy could somehow adequately value this potential, a lot of these\\nproblems might solve themselves (as the cost of labor would be prohibitive).\\n\\n#### Maintenance Work\\n\\nThis kind of work is currently necessary work that keeps society from\\nbacksliding.  It is extremely important, but we should be working to automate\\nit or find ways to avoid needing it to make progress.\\n\\n#### Service Work\\n\\nIn my opinion, most service work is already unnecessary given the alternatives.\\nIt makes me sad to see so many people working as waiters/waitresses, cashiers,\\nin call centers, etc. when there are (often better) systems that provide the\\nsame service without requiring people.\\n\\n#### Not Seeing the Potential\\n\\nRejecting the idea that all humans have creative potential is commonplace, and\\ngreatly harms the many people that are discriminated against when selection for\\ncreative roles occurs. TODO flesh this out.\\n\\n### Death\\n\\nThe death of an individual is extremely tragic for at least these reasons:\\n\\n - All the knowledge and perspective the individual accumulated over their\\n   lifetime is lost permanently. Records can only partially remedy this.\\n - The social web the person was a part of is violently damaged.\\n - The people close to the dying person suffer greatly and are less able to\\n   create for a time (sometimes permanently).\\n\\nTo protect ourselves emotionally, we have built traditions and societal norms\\naround accepting death and treating it an inevitable.  Given our progress\\ntowards understanding aging (the cause of the vast majority of deaths), this is\\nstarting to become a problem.\\n\\n### War\\n\\nThe terrible combination of the above two problems. Should be avoided at all\\ncosts.\\n\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\nIn my opinion, we should be putting **all** people to work solving the above\\nproblems. In doing so, we should be able to reach utopia more quickly, and in\\nso doing alleviate much suffering.\\n\\n### Humanity's Superpower\\n\\nPeople have the uniquely powerful ability to come up with arbitrary\\nexplanations for how stuff works and then critically compare them against each\\nother. This creative process has led to all major advances in human history,\\nand is responsible for the accelerating rate of progress we all enjoy today.\\nThis progress is in turn responsible for alleviating a tremendous amount of\\nsuffering, and for creating a myriad of new ways for people to feel happy,\\nsatisfied, or otherwise good.  It also has enabled people to automate many time\\nand energy consuming tasks that have historically either directly caused\\nsuffering, or gotten in the way of further progress and/or doing things that\\nfeel good.\\n\\nCreative thought as I've defined it is the most important tool we have to\\nimprove our state as a species (and to continue avoiding existential threats).\\nTherefore, we should be primarily orienting our society to encourage creative\\nthought and reduce the amount of time required to engage in non-creative work\\nto keep things running. If we can successfully do this, then we will maximize\\nour ability to solve all other hard problems facing our species, such as\\nresource shortages, aging, climate change, and successfully governing\\nourselves. Additionally, arguably people will lead more fulfilling lives, as\\nmore of their time will be spent thinking about interesting things and sharing\\nthose thoughts as opposed to grinding away at Sisyphean maintenance tasks.\\n\\nHow can we do this?\\n\\n### Basic Need Automation\\n\\nWe need to ensure that every person on earth has their basic (food, shelter,\\nmedicine, mental health) needs met through automation. Worrying about basic\\nneeds is probably the biggest distraction away from creative thought that\\nexists today.\\n\\nA simple solution to this would be to supply everyone with a nanofabricator\\nthat can produce food, tools, and everything else required to survive.\\nUnfortunately, currently this solution is still science fiction, and we instead\\nmust rely on large shared systems that utilize economies of scale to provide\\nneeds at a minimum cost. Distributing resources in these systems is hard, and\\nour growing wealth inequality today is evidence that we are doing a poor job.\\nSolving this problem via some kind of universal basic income seems at least\\nworth trying.\\n\\n### Freedom of Information and Education\\n\\nIt's hard to think creatively when you have no prior ideas to remix together\\ninto new ones. Making information and educational resources universally\\naccessible and engaging is crucial to spark creativity. To do this we should\\ncontinue encouraging the growth of the internet, and the growth of free and\\nopen publication of scientific discovery (and thoughts in general). People who\\nwrite down novel ideas should have their needs covered by the automation\\ndescribed above, and therefore will not need to worry about how to monetize\\ntheir work (which wastes everyone's time and energy, and cuts people out of the\\ncreative process).\\n\\n\\n### Freedom of Direction\\n\\nIn the book \\\"Greatness Cannot be Planned: The Myth of the Objective\\\", the\\nauthors argue that all hard problems suffer from deceptive paths to their\\nsolutions. Therefore, attempting to grade or judge performance by comparing a\\ncurrent state to a specific goal is misleading. This focus on objective\\nthinking is particularly dangerous when applied to people - using objectives to\\nencourage someone to do X or Y stifles that persons ability to exercise their\\nmost powerful tool: their creativity. Instead, that person will just act in\\naccordance with the given objective, even if they have novel ideas they would\\notherwise try to pursue.\\n\\nTo approach utopia, it makes sense to try to constrain the behavior of\\nindividuals as little as possible so that the most novel ideas can be explored.\\nOne way this could be conceptualized is by encouraging\\n[flaneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur)-like behavior as\\ndescribed in \\\"Antifragile\\\" by NN Taleb. This has the additional side benefit of\\ngiving people space, time, and therefore ability to support the ideas of others\\nthat they discover and think are important.\\n\\n#### Organizations\\n\\nThis concept can also apply to larger organizations of many people, like local\\ngovernments.  If those governments have a lot of freedom to experiment with\\ndifferent policies, this could lead to discovery of the best policies overall.\\nIn practice, this would looks like a confederation of autonomous states, like\\nSwitzerland and to a lesser extent the United States of America.\\n\\nAt the government level, this experimentation can be dangerous, so it is\\ncrucial that people are able to leave governments that they anticipate will\\nharm them. This means that both some kind of universal bill of rights and\\nresources that help people move are extremely important.\\n\\n\\n## Influences\\n\\nThis is heavily inspired by\\n[The Beginning of\\nInfinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity) by David\\nDeutsch.\\n\\nCategories: [Understanding The World]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Understanding-The-World=true)\"\n    :name \"utopia.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Understanding The World\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 7490\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe.md\"\n    :title \"What To Believe\"\n    :markdown \"# What to Believe\\n\\nIn order to make good decisions, people need to build an understanding of how\\nthe world works by gathering information.  Luckily, it is getting easier and\\neasier to do this as technology becomes more and more efficient at sending data\\naround the world.  Unfortunately, simply gathering information is not enough;\\none must also make sure that the information is of high enough quality to use\\nin world modelling or decision making.\\n\\nThere are many reasons why information people share with each other may be\\nmisleading or wrong.  \\n\\n\\nhttps://thedietwars.com/how-to-determine-who-is-a-legitimate-science-based-health-expert/\\n\\n\\n## Stories\\n\\nTo transfer information, people share stories with each other.  These stories\\nget etched in people's minds as they hear them, and can get more deeply etched\\nwith repetition or other validation.\\n\\nMany (technically most) stories are not accurate descriptions of the real,\\nphysical world.  \\n\\nInaccurate stories can be useful.  For instance, they can be \\\"stepping stones\\nto the truth\\\", like our story about how electrons are particles that orbit the\\nnucleus of an atom (Bohr model).  They can also provide practical ways to\\nencourage a behavior; for instance, the story that virtuous people are rewarded\\nin the afterlife.  Or auervedic medicine promoting health.\\n\\nUnfortunately, inaccuracy can also lead to bad decision making with serious\\nconsequences.  To be safe, it would be ideal if we could clearly determine\\ninaccuracy and weight that in our consideration of whether or not to use the\\nstory in informing our behavior.\\n\\n\\n## Story Plausability vs Accuracy\\n\\nFirstly, it is important to know that **plausability DOES NOT correlate well\\nwith accuracy**, especially in complex systems.  There are many, many more\\nplausable statements about systems like our economy or the human body that\\nthere are statements which are actually true.  Some random examples (NOT MY\\nOPINIONS):\\n\\n### Health\\n\\n - Any dietary sugar crystallizes in the blood, causing arterial damage.\\n - Sugar has no harmful effects on the body when <50g/day are consumed.\\n - Saturated fat hardens in the blood, clogging arteries.\\n - Saturated fat does not clog arteries, it gets dissolved in blood just fine.\\n\\n### Economy\\n\\n - Poor people are poor because they don't work hard.\\n - Poor people are poor because powerful people with malicious intent are\\n   taking their resources.\\n - Poor people are poor because our economy makes it hard to increase your net\\n   worth.\\n\\n\\n### Education\\n\\n - Girls and boys have inherent (from birth) differences in what topics they\\n   are interested in, and therefore end up finding careers in.\\n - Girls and boys have the same chance to become interested in something at\\n   birth, but are unevenly distributed in careers due to how they are raised.\\n\\nMore theories like this that were widely believed but are now disproven can be\\nfound on [this Wikipedia\\npage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_theories_in_science). Also [this\\nstudy of medical\\ntherapies](https://twitter.com/kevinnbass/status/1184599630312427520).\\n\\nNote that some stories can be completely true, but still not have the effect\\nthey imply.  For instance, certain foods contain toxins that kill and/or\\nmutate our cells.  But this does not mean that we shouldn't eat those foods\\n(perhaps every foods falls into this category?).\\n\\nFor each of the above statements/stories, there are groups of people who would\\nfind them plausible.  Since some directly contradict each other, how are we to\\nknow which to believe?\\n\\n\\n## The Scientific Method\\n\\nWe can use scientific reasoning to falsify inaccurate stories!  Ideally, we\\nwould do this for all information we incorporate into our decisions; if no one\\nhas tried to falsify a certain piece of information, then we probably shouldn't\\nuse it for important decision making.\\n\\nUnfortunately, science is really hard, so many falsification studies have not\\nbeen done.  Additionally, science doesn't give hard yes-or-no answers - it\\ngives probabilities (e.g. p-values) that something might be true given a long\\nlist of assumptions or constraints.  Context is crucially important - studies\\ngenerally are very narrow in the situations they apply to! In order to\\naccurately incorporate a scientific finding into a justification for making a\\ncertain decision, the uncertainties in the study and the required context to\\napply it should be understood.  \\n\\nOh yeah, also scientific studies can just be wrong due to errors in their\\nexecution, even if the experimenters themselves were unbiased. A good practical\\nway to get around this problem is to [read review articles instead of\\nindividual\\nstudies](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/).\\n\\nIt is hard to do this, just like it is hard to come up with scientific findings\\nin the first place.  If we as a society deeply recognized this difficulty, it\\nmay give more respect to good scientific findings, and help us have more\\ninformed debated about what actions to take on big important issues.  This\\nrecognition may also make people more patient and willing to embrace the\\ndifficulty, instead of looking for shortcuts. \\n\\n(I have nothing against finding the most efficient ways to solve problems,\\nexcept when these shortcuts are less rigorous or otherwise worse than harder\\nsolutions AND we pretend that they are just as good just because of their\\nconvenience).\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\n - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper\\n - \\\"The Beginning of Infinity\\\" by David Deutsch\\n\\n\\n## People and Stories\\n\\nWhen it comes to deciding what stories are accurate, or worth etching deeply\\ninto your own mind, it is important to select stories which have had a lot of\\neffort put towards their falsification, but still hold up.  To verify this\\nprocess, it is ideal to try your hardest to falsify the story in question\\nyourself.  \\n\\nLooking at what others believe is a good way to find new stories, and also can\\nbe a good way to vet stories.  It is crucial however to think about WHY\\nbelievers trust the stories they do.  If they have not actively tried to\\nfalsify their own stories, that is a red flag that their belief may not be\\nsound.  Evidence that people have tried this falsification includes:\\n\\n - Advertisement of conditions under which their story does not hold true.\\n - Write ups of experiments that were done in the effort of falsification.\\n\\nAt a higher level, if the person in question has a history of changing their\\nbeliefs when shown new evidence, that is also a good sign.\\n\\nFor those people who have a long history of believing the same story, or have\\nfinancial or social incentives to believe said story, be wary that their\\nconfirmation bias may blind them a bit to new information.\\n\\nIn extreme cases, people who do not try to falsify their own stories can become\\nzealots; so blind to the limitation of their own beliefs that there is no\\npractical difference between them and someone who is intentionally promoting a\\nbelief they know to be wrong (lying).\\n\\nOne thing to note is that people holding hard to old beliefs seems to be a\\nnatural thing for humans to do, and there are ways to exploit this without\\nchanging people's minds: \\n\\n - [VSauce reasoning video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ArVh3Cj9rw)_\\n - [Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile) discusses how it\\n   might be ideal to have many strongly supported ideas fight it out in e.g. a\\n   market to find the best ones and move the whole system forward optimally.\\n\\nThis is related to the idea of \\\"science advances one funeral at a time\\\",\\nwhich assumes that (1) famous accomplished sciences direct future research and\\n(2) these scientists have entrenched beliefs.  These things combined mean new\\nresearch directions that do not fit into the beliefs of the accomplished\\nscientists do not get funding/attention.  It would be nice if this wasn't as\\ntrue, but at the least there is still advancement \\\\*shrug\\\\*.\\n\\n### Reasons People Share Ideas\\n\\nThinking about why an idea is being shared might make your decision of whether\\nto believe it or not easier.  Note that all of these reasons are extremely\\nimportant and enable our modern society; I'm not saying that if you are\\nlistening to e.g. an advocate you can just ignore everything they are saying.\\n\\n - **Truth Sharing**: Simply to share the truth to others, for them to do what\\n   they will with it. This type of sharing happens a lot in dense academic\\n   research papers that effectively just share numbers and contain very little\\n   interpretation.  It's easy to think you are doing this when you actually\\n   aren't. Examples:\\n    - Michael Lustgarten's YouTube Channel\\n - **Advocacy**: To change the behavior of others. For instance, sharing\\n   pictures of smoker's lungs to get people to stop smoking. Or to get atheists\\n   to accept God.\\n    - Public health initiatives\\n    - COVID vaccine advertisements\\n - **Brainstorming/Theorizing**: To get others to think about a problem or\\n   model of the world that might be useful or inaccurate. Partially in the\\n   hopes that others will find the model useful, and partially in the hopes\\n   that others will improve or soundly reject the model.\\n    - \\\"Why Greatness Cannot be Planned\\\" by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman\\n\\n### Belief Matrix\\n\\nThe following matrix provides a simplified view of how a person can stand **on\\na single statement**.  The East/West axis describes how strongly the person\\nagrees or disagrees with a statement. The North/South axis describes the level\\nof evidence that person **personally understands and accepts** that supports\\nthe statement. Note that \\\"scientific consensus\\\" does **not** mean agreement of\\nmany trusted scientists, but rather the agreement of their work itself (e.g.\\ncompiled and reviewed by the person trying to form an opinion).  Therefore, for\\nexample, if a person personally accepts strong evidence supporting the\\nstatement, yet disagrees with the statement, they must be lying.\\n\\nNote that it is very difficult to know the extent of understanding a person has\\nabout an issue. Therefore, it can be hard to distinguish between liars and\\nskeptics, or even zealots supporting the counter-idea and liars. At least we\\ncan make some assumptions about the popularity/availability of scientific\\nstudies; if an \\\"expert\\\" in a field ignores very available work, it's more\\nlikely they are not an honest knowledge spreader.\\n\\n```\\n                             Scientific Consensus\\n                             Understood by Person\\n             ----------------------------------------------------\\n             |                         |                        |\\n             |  A Liar or propagandist |  Someone spreading     |\\n             |  with hidden motives    |  real information      |\\n             |  (good or bad).         |                        | \\n             ------------------A Plausible Idea------------------\\n             |                         |                        |\\nVocal        |    A skeptic            |  A zealot or person    | Vocal\\nDisagreement |                         |  with blind belief     | Agreement\\n             |                         |                        |\\n             ------------------A Plausible Idea------------------\\n             |                         |                        |\\n             | Someone spreading       | A liar or propagandist |\\n             | real information        | with hidden motives    |\\n             |                         | (good or bad).         |\\n             --------------------------------------------------\\n                            Scientific Rejection\\n                            Understood by Person\\n```\\nI personally believe the plausible idea (I haven't looked for or found studies\\nyet) that certain people can be more amenable to falling into a certain\\nquadrant quickly when given some idea. And additionally, if someone is shown to\\nbe OK with lying about ideas in one area, they are probably more likely to do\\nso in other areas as well. Probably then, if one wants to save\\ntime/energy/resources reviewing ideas, they could discount those that are\\nsupported by people who have lied or shown blind belief in other ideas.\\n\\n**However**, if one has the time and wants the most complete picture, in my\\nopinion it is worth examining ideas from these people, since (again, in my\\nopinion) it is very unlikely that they are **completely** incorrect in all\\ntheir opinions. In fact, some of the most novel, and therefore potentially\\nuseful, ideas can come especially from strong believers in yet-untested\\nplausible ideas.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\n----------------------- OLD THOUGHTS BELOW HERE ------------------------------\\n\\nOne useful lens to look at this further is to think about where the shared\\ninformation is ultimately coming from:\\n\\n## From Past Personal Experience\\n\\n### What works \\n\\nTinkerers (as described in the book\\n[Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)) are people who use\\nfeedback from a specific task to improve and eventually become experts at doing\\nthat task.  For instance a self-taught woodworker will eventually learn how to\\ncreate complex wooden structures based on past experience of how wood behaves\\nwhen he or she does things to it.  Or a chess player may learn that certain\\npatterns of pieces are dangerous or safe over time after winning or losing many\\ngames.\\n\\nInformation derived from tinkerers is:\\n\\n - Often very practically useful\\n - Rarely completely \\\"wrong\\\", just maybe only right in a very narrow scope.\\n\\nBut has these problems:\\n\\n - Deeper theories or reasons behind why the information is what it is are\\n   often absent or unrecoverable.  This limits the scope at which the\\n   information can be accurately applied.\\n - Reproducing the logic behind the information can be very difficult or\\n   impossible, since it requires walking though the life experience of the\\n   tinkerer.  This can make it easy for the tinkerer to hide bias.\\n\\nCategories: [Understanding The World]({{< relref \\\"/docs/all.md\\\" >}}?Understanding-The-World=true)\"\n    :name \"what-to-believe.md\"\n    :categories #{\"Understanding The World\"}\n    :dir? false\n    :links [\"/docs/all.md\"]\n    :size 13990\n    :modtime 1654364668\n    :mode 416}\n   {:path \"content/docs/visual-art/generative-art.md\"\n    :title \"Generative Art\"\n    :markdown \"# Generative Art\\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\nI was originally inspired to work on generative art after viewing this blog:\\nhttps://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/.
